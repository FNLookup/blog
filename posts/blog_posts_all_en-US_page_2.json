This AR was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong> has received a slight reduction in bullet speed (and an increase in bullet drop), as many Reaper snipes were too easy to land with little counterplay.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Hyper SMG</strong> has received an increase in overall accuracy via tightened bullet spread. Like the Enforcer AR, this SMG was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> has received a slight decrease in damage required to stagger the holder. This loadout option was often too powerful compared to others, especially in Zero Build.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Storm circle speed</strong>, <strong>sprint speed</strong>, and <strong>Energy regeneration</strong> have been reverted to match the same speed from Chapter 4. These reverted&nbsp;speeds better fit the current ideal pace of Fortnite BR.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nWe\u2019ll continue to monitor gameplay data alongside community feedback and make future balance adjustments if necessary.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The EMP Stealth Camo, Cardboard Boxes, and Anvil Rocket Launcher are not included in tournaments.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Fortnite Championship Series 2024 begins soon!
