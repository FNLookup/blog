While making hot new lap times, you can unlock the <strong>Sprintspark Trail</strong> (and its many colors!) with new Quests.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Speed Run Mode\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-speed-run-mode-1920x1080-843f1118be0e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCatch Up on Speed Run</h2>\n\n<p>Ready to prove you\u2019re one of the fastest Rocket Racing drivers? Then get ready because in Speed Run you\u2019ll be up against the toughest opponent of all: the clock.</p>\n\n<p>Try to set the best possible <strong>lap time</strong> on variants of some of your favorite tracks like Riviera, Anaconda, and Olympus. Each match has a countdown timer of several minutes, giving you plenty of time to complete multiple laps (<strong>\u201cruns\u201d</strong>) and create your perfect route to the finish line!<br />\n<br />\nWhile zooming along in Speed Run, don\u2019t be scared when you spot your <strong>ghost</strong>. This not-so-spooky apparition is there to show you exactly how you drove on your best run of the match \u2014 correct its mistakes to shave precious seconds off your lap time.<br />\n<br />\nYou can play Speed Run in either public or private matches. If playing with others, don\u2019t worry about crashing into them. <strong>Player collisions are turned off</strong> in Speed Run so you can focus on your lap times. On the flip side, you can\u2019t catch players\u2019 slipstreams by drafting. Starting line boosts are disabled in this mode as well.<br />\n<br />\nYour fastest run time on a track will be uploaded to that track\u2019s <strong>Season leaderboard</strong> so you see how your skills rack up against drivers worldwide. There\u2019s also a <strong>friends leaderboard </strong>where you can compare your times with your Epic friends for bragging rights! Don\u2019t rest on your laurels, though, as the leaderboards will refresh each Season.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nDue to an issue, the global filters of Season leaderboards are disabled until a future update. We\u2019ll keep you updated when they return. In the meantime, you can still compete with your Epic friends on the friends leaderboards!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nTo access this new mode, simply choose a track in Rocket Racing\u2019s Speed Run row or select the Speed Run playlist with rotating tracks.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nElectrifying Quests!</h2>\n\n<p>All good quests start with a spark! Complete runs in Speed Run to progress in the <strong>Speed Run Kickoff Quests</strong>. By completing the first Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the new <strong>Sprintspark Trail</strong>! Complete the rest of the Quests to unlock 13 paint colors for Sprintspark.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Sprintspark Trail\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-sprintspark-trail-1920x1080-4ce83147114b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will be available until March 26, 2024, at 12 AM ET.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will now be available until April 9, 2024, at 12 AM ET!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nMore Improvements on Mobile</h2>\n\n<p>v28.30 features further enhancements to playing Rocket Racing on mobile:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The touchscreen D-pad has been updated to a touchscreen joystick, allowing for better precision when driving. You can adjust the sensitivity of the joystick in the settings.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We\u2019ve updated the visuals of the mobile HUD.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nDiestro Comes to the Fortnite Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>It might look retro, but the <strong>Diestro Car Body</strong> is all modern power! Take it for a spin in Rocket Racing and other experiences across Fortnite. This Rocket League-original is available in the Shop as part of the <strong>Diestro Car Bundle</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Diestro Car Body (has 13 paint colors)</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Chitchat Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Lozano Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Old Flame Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Sooo Fly Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Stripes Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Stuntman Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Decals in the Diestro Car Bundle can only be equipped with the Diestro Car Body. If you already have Diestro and the Decals in Rocket League, you\u2019ll find them waiting in your Fortnite Locker thanks to <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/news/use-items-across-fortnite-and-rocket-league-with-cross-game-ownership\">cross-game ownership</a>! If you purchase the Diestro Car Bundle in Fortnite, you\u2019ll have the contents in Rocket League.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Diestro\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-diestro-1920x1080-53876f0125e3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nLook Flash with Xenosplash!&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>So concentrated on the road you're in another world? The <strong>Xenosplash Boost</strong> comes to the Fortnite ecosystem via the Xenosplash Boost Bundle! This Bundle in the Shop includes the Boost plus 13 different paint colors \ud83c\udfa8<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Xenosplash Boost\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-xenosplash-boost-1920x1080-882ba4d92d34.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re feeling illustrious, consider pairing this Boost with the <strong>Lustrum X10 Wheels</strong> also making their Fortnite debut. These Wheels are available in the Shop via the Lustrum X10 Wheels Bundle, which includes the Wheels and 12 different paint colors!<br />\n<br />\nLike Diestro, the Xenosplash Boost and Lustrum X10 Wheels are eligible for cross-game ownership.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>You can now perform an <strong>Air Roll</strong>!&nbsp;Just hold the left trigger button while midair (or the spacebar on PC) and steer to spin through the air. You can also pair your rolls with your thrusters to fly across the track. We\u2019re looking for feedback on this new advanced mechanic, so let us know what you think.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Various Quests have been adjusted so that they can be progressed by playing Speed Run, Racing, or both! Quest descriptions have also been updated to reflect this.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>Further improvements to collisions while grounded have been made when hitting the environment to prevent getting stuck. We will continue to make improvements as needed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Improved checkpoint crossing times, and exposed one more millisecond digit to the scoreboard for more accurate time tracking.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Increased the minimum speed to demolish in the air when hitting the front of the car, to match the speed required to demolish when grounded (400 KPH).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Achieving a new drift boost while one is already active will now always give you the full impulse for a short duration instead of only making up the difference. This was partially the case in v28.20, but drift boosts that were smaller than the one you had were only 50% as effective.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>While you\u2019re drifting, your wheels should now visually steer more sharply.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You can no longer get bonus speed from a speed pad if your car already has an active stack of bonus speed from that same speed pad. You can still stack bonus speed from multiple different speed pads.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fixed an issue causing cars to sometimes launch backwards when landing an aerial drift after performing a lateral air dodge.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n",
