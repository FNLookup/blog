            "content": "<p>Pandora\u2019s Box has been opened on the Fortnite Battle Royale Island, bringing Olympus to the battlefield. Olympian legends \u2014 including Hades and the thunder god Zeus \u2014 now rule the Island in otherworldly rage. To make matters worse, they\u2019ve brought their powers and weapons with them. Use their mythological means against them in <strong>Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths &amp; Mortals</strong>!</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aOAiUwz7Zt8?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2><br />\nLegendary Locations</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMount Olympus</h3>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t have Olympus without <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>. Home of Zeus, you\u2019ll always feel like you\u2019re being watched with the grand monument that graces this great mountain.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Mount Olympus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-mount-olympus-1920x1080-5537be42c18f.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGrim Gate</h3>\n\n<p>To get to \"The Underworld,\" one way to get there is crossing the river at <strong>Grim Gate</strong>\u2026 where the three-headed guard dog Cerberus awaits. Venture to the west of the Island to confront these canines!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grim Gate\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grim-gate-1920x1080-e353ba2d47e2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nThe Underworld</h3>\n\n<p>Past the hounds is the home of Hades: <strong>The Underworld</strong>. Despite its flowing streams, the land of this city is almost completely dried up.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite The Underworld\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-the-underworld-1920x1080-1a59002a1413.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nBrawler\u2019s Battleground</h3>\n\n<p>The god of war, Ares always welcomes a battle. Take him up on his challenge in the&nbsp;<strong>Brawler\u2019s Battleground</strong> arena south of Mount Olympus. (Oh yeah, Ares will be the Outfit of the April 2024 Crew Pack!)<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Brawler's Battleground\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-brawlers-battleground-1920x1080-28674310ab9a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThese are just some of the locations the gods brought to the Island. However, don\u2019t forget what else they\u2019ve brought with them\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nChaos Upon the Land</h2>\n\n<p>The gods descended with their powers and weapons, but that doesn\u2019t mean your next battle has to end in tragedy. Make your next battle a myth to remember by using them for yourself!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nThunderbolt of Zeus</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thunderbolt of Zeus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thunderbolt-of-zeus-1920x1080-0d46477b195d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nBecome a Storm of your own. With the <strong>Thunderbolt of Zeus</strong>, you can rise into the air and hurl lightning bolts at your target! Use this power wisely though, as the Thunderbolt of Zeus has three maximum charges with a cooldown between each one. How to wield this electricity? Pick up this Mythic power across the Island or by defeating Zeus himself.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGatekeeper Shotgun</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Gatekeeper Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-gatekeeper-shotgun-1920x1080-11ced08de565.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nForged by Hephaestus for Cerberus, the <strong>Gatekeeper Shotgun</strong> can quickly fire three aggressive rounds. This Shotgun is best at short range, so hit all three shots fast to show your bite\u2019s as bad as your bark! When you\u2019re done, prepare for your next target with a full magazine reload. The Gatekeeper Shotgun can be found across the Island, but the Mythic variant is only obtainable from Cerberus rolling over.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHarbinger SMG</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Harbinger SMG\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-harbinger-smg-1920x1080-73e6932eceb0.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nLike Hades himself, the <strong>Harbinger SMG</strong> is unforgiving and relentless \u2014 even when exhausted. Highly accurate when first shot, it has dramatically increased recoil and bloom as more bullets are fired. But that doesn\u2019t stop it from going all out. Find the regular version across the Island or the Mythic version from defeating Hades.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHuntress DMR</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Huntress DMR\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-huntress-dmr-1920x1080-f3544058c0ca.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nArtemis, goddess of the moonlit hunt. During battle, take a note from Artemis and use a weapon created to dole out punishment from a distance. Even though it was created for gods to punish mortals, flip the script and use the <strong>Huntress DMR</strong> to punish the gods (and some mortals too we guess). You can hunt for Huntress DMRs across the Island\u2026 or get the Mythic version by hunting down Zeus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nWarforged Assault Rifle</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Warforged Assault Rifle\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-warforged-assault-rifle-1920x1080-ca546d212315.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Warforged Assault Rifle</strong> is forged for battle-hungry gods \u2014 which is why it\u2019s the favorite of Ares. Powerful yet unruly, this Assault Rifle has high damage, high rate of fire, and strong recoil. Find one across the Island or fight Ares for the Mythic version!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nAnother Power\u2026 the Power of Flight!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Wings of Icarus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-wings-of-icarus-1900x600-f55f15c9f27d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Thunderbolt of Zeus isn\u2019t the only Olympian Power. With the <strong>Wings of Icarus</strong>, soar through the skies and divebomb your foes below! But beware: fly too long and your wings will burn up, and taking too much damage may lead to a crash landing. Find this Mythic power across the Island!<br />\n<br />\nYet another Olympian Power is coming your way \u2014 the <strong>Chains of Hades</strong> will pull you in later this Season...</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUnderground in The Underworld: Weapons from Last Season</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike Orpheus looking back at Eurydice, you\u2019re allowed to turn to the weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. Here\u2019s a list of the weapons returning from last Season:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Nemesis AR</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranger Pistol</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMyths &amp; Mods</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thermal Scope and Speedgrip Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thermal-scope-and-speedgrip-mods-1900x600-1fa1cf60430d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s not enough that weapons descended from Olympus \u2014 the <strong>Thermal Scope</strong> and <strong>Speedgrip</strong> weapon mods did too. Also forged by Hephaestus, the Thermal Scope mod can be attached to any scoped weapon. Want vision like that of the gods? It more than doubles the scope view and has a thermal effect you can toggle on or off! With the Speedgrip mod, your movement speed while aiming will increase. Aim true and don\u2019t tarry!<br />\n<br />\nLike last Season, you can find mods at Mod Benches, but this time the benches are in new <strong>Weapons Bunkers</strong>. The bunkers that are unchained will unlock in the middle of the match, when they become ready to raid! If mods aren\u2019t your M.O., Weapons Bunkers also have\u2026 weapons.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Myths Materialize in the Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside Chapter 5 Season 2 comes the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</a>!

Later in the Season, unlock the Avatar <strong>Korra</strong>! The Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass will be available to progress in until May 24, 2024, at 2 AM ET.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nRanked Zero Build - NA Matchmaking Test</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Ranked Zero Build Matchmaking Test\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/ranked-zero-build-matchmaking-test-1920x1080-0db647824423.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nRanked ZB players in North America!<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve heard your feedback about longer queue times at the upper Zero Build ranks. To address this, we\u2019re doing a test! The NA-East and NA-West matchmaking regions will route to the NA-Central matchmaking region <strong>for Ranked Zero Build</strong>. This is so that Ranked Zero Build players in North America will be up against a wider pool of players, which means shorter queue times. The results of this test will determine if this is a long-term solution.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMore Ranked Updates</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Ranked Updates\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/ranked-updates-1920x1080-e0aeab279bda.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe following updates apply to both Ranked Battle Royale and Ranked Zero Build:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>We tweaked progression in the upper ranks to make it harder and more rewarding to reach Unreal.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>Points are no longer granted for surviving without taking damage.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Competitive Notes\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/competitive-notes-1920x1080-ebc8a003d072.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nHave the competitive spirit of Ares?

While making hot new lap times, you can unlock the <strong>Sprintspark Trail</strong> (and its many colors!) with new Quests.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Speed Run Mode\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-speed-run-mode-1920x1080-843f1118be0e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCatch Up on Speed Run</h2>\n\n<p>Ready to prove you\u2019re one of the fastest Rocket Racing drivers? Then get ready because in Speed Run you\u2019ll be up against the toughest opponent of all: the clock.</p>\n\n<p>Try to set the best possible <strong>lap time</strong> on variants of some of your favorite tracks like Riviera, Anaconda, and Olympus. Each match has a countdown timer of several minutes, giving you plenty of time to complete multiple laps (<strong>\u201cruns\u201d</strong>) and create your perfect route to the finish line!<br />\n<br />\nWhile zooming along in Speed Run, don\u2019t be scared when you spot your <strong>ghost</strong>. This not-so-spooky apparition is there to show you exactly how you drove on your best run of the match \u2014 correct its mistakes to shave precious seconds off your lap time.<br />\n<br />\nYou can play Speed Run in either public or private matches. If playing with others, don\u2019t worry about crashing into them. <strong>Player collisions are turned off</strong> in Speed Run so you can focus on your lap times. On the flip side, you can\u2019t catch players\u2019 slipstreams by drafting. Starting line boosts are disabled in this mode as well.<br />\n<br />\nYour fastest run time on a track will be uploaded to that track\u2019s <strong>Season leaderboard</strong> so you see how your skills rack up against drivers worldwide. There\u2019s also a <strong>friends leaderboard </strong>where you can compare your times with your Epic friends for bragging rights! Don\u2019t rest on your laurels, though, as the leaderboards will refresh each Season.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nDue to an issue, the global filters of Season leaderboards are disabled until a future update. We\u2019ll keep you updated when they return. In the meantime, you can still compete with your Epic friends on the friends leaderboards!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nTo access this new mode, simply choose a track in Rocket Racing\u2019s Speed Run row or select the Speed Run playlist with rotating tracks.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nElectrifying Quests!</h2>\n\n<p>All good quests start with a spark! Complete runs in Speed Run to progress in the <strong>Speed Run Kickoff Quests</strong>. By completing the first Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the new <strong>Sprintspark Trail</strong>! Complete the rest of the Quests to unlock 13 paint colors for Sprintspark.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Sprintspark Trail\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-sprintspark-trail-1920x1080-4ce83147114b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will be available until March 26, 2024, at 12 AM ET.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will now be available until April 9, 2024, at 12 AM ET!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nMore Improvements on Mobile</h2>\n\n<p>v28.30 features further enhancements to playing Rocket Racing on mobile:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The touchscreen D-pad has been updated to a touchscreen joystick, allowing for better precision when driving. You can adjust the sensitivity of the joystick in the settings.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We\u2019ve updated the visuals of the mobile HUD.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nDiestro Comes to the Fortnite Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>It might look retro, but the <strong>Diestro Car Body</strong> is all modern power! Take it for a spin in Rocket Racing and other experiences across Fortnite. This Rocket League-original is available in the Shop as part of the <strong>Diestro Car Bundle</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Diestro Car Body (has 13 paint colors)</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Chitchat Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Lozano Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Old Flame Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Sooo Fly Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Stripes Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Stuntman Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Decals in the Diestro Car Bundle can only be equipped with the Diestro Car Body. If you already have Diestro and the Decals in Rocket League, you\u2019ll find them waiting in your Fortnite Locker thanks to <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/news/use-items-across-fortnite-and-rocket-league-with-cross-game-ownership\">cross-game ownership</a>! If you purchase the Diestro Car Bundle in Fortnite, you\u2019ll have the contents in Rocket League.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Diestro\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-diestro-1920x1080-53876f0125e3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nLook Flash with Xenosplash!&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>So concentrated on the road you're in another world? The <strong>Xenosplash Boost</strong> comes to the Fortnite ecosystem via the Xenosplash Boost Bundle! This Bundle in the Shop includes the Boost plus 13 different paint colors \ud83c\udfa8<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Xenosplash Boost\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-xenosplash-boost-1920x1080-882ba4d92d34.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re feeling illustrious, consider pairing this Boost with the <strong>Lustrum X10 Wheels</strong> also making their Fortnite debut. These Wheels are available in the Shop via the Lustrum X10 Wheels Bundle, which includes the Wheels and 12 different paint colors!<br />\n<br />\nLike Diestro, the Xenosplash Boost and Lustrum X10 Wheels are eligible for cross-game ownership.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>You can now perform an <strong>Air Roll</strong>!&nbsp;Just hold the left trigger button while midair (or the spacebar on PC) and steer to spin through the air. You can also pair your rolls with your thrusters to fly across the track. We\u2019re looking for feedback on this new advanced mechanic, so let us know what you think.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Various Quests have been adjusted so that they can be progressed by playing Speed Run, Racing, or both! Quest descriptions have also been updated to reflect this.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>Further improvements to collisions while grounded have been made when hitting the environment to prevent getting stuck. We will continue to make improvements as needed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Improved checkpoint crossing times, and exposed one more millisecond digit to the scoreboard for more accurate time tracking.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Increased the minimum speed to demolish in the air when hitting the front of the car, to match the speed required to demolish when grounded (400 KPH).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Achieving a new drift boost while one is already active will now always give you the full impulse for a short duration instead of only making up the difference. This was partially the case in v28.20, but drift boosts that were smaller than the one you had were only 50% as effective.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>While you\u2019re drifting, your wheels should now visually steer more sharply.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You can no longer get bonus speed from a speed pad if your car already has an active stack of bonus speed from that same speed pad. You can still stack bonus speed from multiple different speed pads.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fixed an issue causing cars to sometimes launch backwards when landing an aerial drift after performing a lateral air dodge.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n",

This Pass has both a free reward track and Premium Reward Track upgrade.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn the Premium Reward Track, keep the crowd roaring to unlock Lady Gaga-themed Instruments and the <strong>Engimatic Gaga Outfit</strong>!

During Season 2, content creators in the <a href=\"https://sac.epicgames.com/overview\">Support-A-Creator (SAC)</a> program will be able to host VOD content on YouTube featuring a selection of Jam Tracks and their loops (see below) and monetize it. No takedown notifications should occur during this time. The selection of Jam Tracks will change each week on <strong>Thursdays at 10 AM ET</strong>, so keep checking back to see what\u2019s safe to feature in your content!<br />\n<br />\nMore info:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In order to monetize their content featuring the Jam Tracks, SAC members need to link their YouTube and Support-A-Creator accounts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When uploading the content to YouTube, be sure to upload it as Unlisted or Public.
