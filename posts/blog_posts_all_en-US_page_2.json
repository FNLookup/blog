This AR was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong> has received a slight reduction in bullet speed (and an increase in bullet drop), as many Reaper snipes were too easy to land with little counterplay.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Hyper SMG</strong> has received an increase in overall accuracy via tightened bullet spread. Like the Enforcer AR, this SMG was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> has received a slight decrease in damage required to stagger the holder. This loadout option was often too powerful compared to others, especially in Zero Build.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Storm circle speed</strong>, <strong>sprint speed</strong>, and <strong>Energy regeneration</strong> have been reverted to match the same speed from Chapter 4.

Check out what\u2019s changed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Placing a build will now remove any small bushes, rocks, or plants that are in the way.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You can now more reliably place builds on slopes.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Want more Building Parts? A variety of new sizes and styles for Floors, Walls, and Roofs have been added so you can fill in gaps and have more options available!</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You can now abandon a build in progress. This will leave any parts already placed and remove the blue preview parts so you can continue customizing your creation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>It\u2019s now more obvious when you\u2019re using Snap Mode, and we\u2019ve added more snap points to Building Parts so that they lock together easier.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\nJust Village Things</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Bushranger, Rustler, and Tomatohead can now appear as potential Villagers to join your adventure!</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Villages can now be instantly removed with the \u201cDelete Village\u201d option in the Village Square. This new option is available to the world owner and keyholders.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Don\u2019t want a Villager in town anymore?

Keep your hands firm on the steering wheel as you take on hazards working overtime.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Lazy Lake 2\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-lazy-lake-2-1920x1080-3b16c39ce4b1.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nNext up is <strong>K2 Raceway Deux</strong>, where you\u2019ll speed across winding roads and catch plenty of air.

            "content": "<p>Hey all!<br />\n<br />\nSince The Big Bang, we\u2019ve cooked up some improvements to Fortnite Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Festival. Today\u2019s update hits key areas that we want to address before our next update planned for early 2024.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Battle Royale</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMovement Improvements</h3>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 html5-video\">\n<video class=\"sXBfhcA\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"auto\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"100%\"><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/241015-fnbr-movement-social-clip-en-esrb-blog-aae2d98ffed3.mp4\" /><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/241015-fnbr-movement-social-clip-en-esrb-blog-aae2d98ffed3.mp4\" /></video>\n</div>\n\n<p>Movement speed has been increased when crouching, and running. We also reduced camera movement and adjusted the change in view while sprinting to encourage a smoother experience. Plus, we updated the movement animations to better match the adjustments in speed.<br />\n<br />\nTo help you get adjusted to these updates, we\u2019ve reset everyone\u2019s \u201cCustom Diagonal Movement\u201d settings, so please log in and reconfigure your settings to what feels best.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nMedallions Readability</h3>\n\n<p>Society Medallion icons now stand out more on the map and should be easier to spot at a glance. We also reduced the visual noise present in the minimap when several Medallion zones are near one another, especially in the later Storm circles.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nNight Visibility</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve brightened certain areas of the map where it was a little too dark during night.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nStorm Visibility</h3>\n\n<p>The visibility of the Storm\u2019s edge has been improved so it\u2019s more apparent how close it is, as we heard from the community it could be difficult to see.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nWeapon Icons</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re aware of feedback that the Frenzy Auto Shotgun and the Thunder Burst SMG weapon icons were too similar, making it hard to differentiate them. These icons have been updated to be more visually unique and legible.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRecent Balance Changes</h3>\n\n<p>Last week, we also released a lot of balance changes to Battle Royale. Here\u2019s a recap!</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Flowberries now grant more Shield.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Increased damage for the Ranger Pistol, Shield Breaker EMP, and Ballistic Shield's pistol.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Snowball Launcher mag size reduced.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Thunder Burst SMG mag size increased.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced the drop rate of the Reaper Sniper Rifle.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Striker AR deals less damage.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The circle indicating a Society Medallion holder is smaller.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Society Medallions now have a brief delay before Shield regen begins. They also have slightly reduced regen rates and no longer refill 100% Shield (unless you have all five).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nLEGO Fortnite</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nHungry? More Filling Snacks!</h3>\n\n<p>We heard feedback that food in LEGO Fortnite wasn\u2019t reducing hunger very much, so we made adjustments to make your snacks more filling!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nElimination While Cavin\u2019</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed a bug that might have made you lose your items after being eliminated in the transition between aboveground and belowground. Thanks for your patience as this was being worked on \u2014 we understand it was frustrating to lose your items (we were losing our items too!).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nIn Case You Missed It</h3>\n\n<p>ICYMI, last week we made the following changes before today\u2019s update:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Durability</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The durability of non-Rare/non-Epic tools and weapons has increased by 30%. For Rare/Epic tools and weapons, the durability has increased by 60%!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Damage</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced damage of the Brute\u2019s Poison area for all three Brutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced damage of the Frost Scorpion explosion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Critter Changes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Sand Scorpions, Scorpions found in caves, regular Scorpions, Crabs on the shoreline, Sand Spiders, and Alpine Frost Spiders are slightly easier to defeat.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Rams now give Heavy Wool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Other Tweaks and Improvements&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Grapplers now hold 30 charges.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Spiders won\u2019t jumpscare you as often when turning over rocks.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nRocket Racing</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nLong Queue Times</h3>\n\n<p>We heard feedback that high-ranked racers have been experiencing long queue times in Rocket Racing, and our team is working on incremental improvements to help you get into your races faster. We\u2019ll continue to monitor queue times and make adjustments if necessary.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCar Collisions</h3>\n\n<p>Car-on-car collisions have been a major topic among players, especially when a bump from behind spins your car 180 degrees. Today's update will make those collisions a bit less punishing, and should help keep your car facing the finish line. We\u2019ll continue to work on collision improvements for future updates too.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nJackie Outfit Quest</h3>\n\n<p>The Reach Gold rank in Rocket Racing Quest to unlock the Jackie Outfit was rewarding players for reaching Gold II instead of Gold I. We\u2019ve patched this so that racers who have hit Gold I now just need to complete one full race to complete the Quest and receive the Jackie Outfit.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Festival</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMissing Song Library</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed an error that caused players to see an empty song library in the Main Stage after suspending Fortnite on their device. This should also improve the pauses some players were encountering before a song starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nFall Damage Disabled</h3>\n\n<p>Fall damage has been disabled in the Main Stage\u2019s Backstage. Jump off all the balconies you\u2019d like, rockstars!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRestart Song&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve disabled the \u201cRestart Song\u201d functionality (available to Solo players) temporarily while we fix an error that was causing the game to become unresponsive.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nIncorrect Posting to Leaderboards&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed an issue where some scores may have been posted to the wrong leaderboard. We will continue to monitor (and potentially audit) leaderboards moving forward to ensure their accuracy.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nThis is just the beginning of the future of Fortnite, and we\u2019re excited to continue improvements where possible. Thank you for sharing your feedback \u2014 we appreciate your passion!</p>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
