            "content": "<p>Pandora\u2019s Box has been opened on the Fortnite Battle Royale Island, bringing Olympus to the battlefield. Olympian legends \u2014 including Hades and the thunder god Zeus \u2014 now rule the Island in otherworldly rage. To make matters worse, they\u2019ve brought their powers and weapons with them. Use their mythological means against them in <strong>Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths &amp; Mortals</strong>!</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aOAiUwz7Zt8?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2><br />\nLegendary Locations</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMount Olympus</h3>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t have Olympus without <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>. Home of Zeus, you\u2019ll always feel like you\u2019re being watched with the grand monument that graces this great mountain.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Mount Olympus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-mount-olympus-1920x1080-5537be42c18f.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGrim Gate</h3>\n\n<p>To get to \"The Underworld,\" one way to get there is crossing the river at <strong>Grim Gate</strong>\u2026 where the three-headed guard dog Cerberus awaits. Venture to the west of the Island to confront these canines!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grim Gate\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grim-gate-1920x1080-e353ba2d47e2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nThe Underworld</h3>\n\n<p>Past the hounds is the home of Hades: <strong>The Underworld</strong>. Despite its flowing streams, the land of this city is almost completely dried up.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite The Underworld\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-the-underworld-1920x1080-1a59002a1413.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nBrawler\u2019s Battleground</h3>\n\n<p>The god of war, Ares always welcomes a battle. Take him up on his challenge in the&nbsp;<strong>Brawler\u2019s Battleground</strong> arena south of Mount Olympus. (Oh yeah, Ares will be the Outfit of the April 2024 Crew Pack!)<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Brawler's Battleground\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-brawlers-battleground-1920x1080-28674310ab9a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThese are just some of the locations the gods brought to the Island. However, don\u2019t forget what else they\u2019ve brought with them\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nChaos Upon the Land</h2>\n\n<p>The gods descended with their powers and weapons, but that doesn\u2019t mean your next battle has to end in tragedy. Make your next battle a myth to remember by using them for yourself!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nThunderbolt of Zeus</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thunderbolt of Zeus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thunderbolt-of-zeus-1920x1080-0d46477b195d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nBecome a Storm of your own. With the <strong>Thunderbolt of Zeus</strong>, you can rise into the air and hurl lightning bolts at your target! Use this power wisely though, as the Thunderbolt of Zeus has three maximum charges with a cooldown between each one. How to wield this electricity? Pick up this Mythic power across the Island or by defeating Zeus himself.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGatekeeper Shotgun</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Gatekeeper Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-gatekeeper-shotgun-1920x1080-11ced08de565.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nForged by Hephaestus for Cerberus, the <strong>Gatekeeper Shotgun</strong> can quickly fire three aggressive rounds. This Shotgun is best at short range, so hit all three shots fast to show your bite\u2019s as bad as your bark! When you\u2019re done, prepare for your next target with a full magazine reload. The Gatekeeper Shotgun can be found across the Island, but the Mythic variant is only obtainable from Cerberus rolling over.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHarbinger SMG</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Harbinger SMG\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-harbinger-smg-1920x1080-73e6932eceb0.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nLike Hades himself, the <strong>Harbinger SMG</strong> is unforgiving and relentless \u2014 even when exhausted. Highly accurate when first shot, it has dramatically increased recoil and bloom as more bullets are fired. But that doesn\u2019t stop it from going all out. Find the regular version across the Island or the Mythic version from defeating Hades.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHuntress DMR</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Huntress DMR\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-huntress-dmr-1920x1080-f3544058c0ca.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nArtemis, goddess of the moonlit hunt. During battle, take a note from Artemis and use a weapon created to dole out punishment from a distance. Even though it was created for gods to punish mortals, flip the script and use the <strong>Huntress DMR</strong> to punish the gods (and some mortals too we guess). You can hunt for Huntress DMRs across the Island\u2026 or get the Mythic version by hunting down Zeus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nWarforged Assault Rifle</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Warforged Assault Rifle\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-warforged-assault-rifle-1920x1080-ca546d212315.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Warforged Assault Rifle</strong> is forged for battle-hungry gods \u2014 which is why it\u2019s the favorite of Ares. Powerful yet unruly, this Assault Rifle has high damage, high rate of fire, and strong recoil. Find one across the Island or fight Ares for the Mythic version!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nAnother Power\u2026 the Power of Flight!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Wings of Icarus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-wings-of-icarus-1900x600-f55f15c9f27d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Thunderbolt of Zeus isn\u2019t the only Olympian Power. With the <strong>Wings of Icarus</strong>, soar through the skies and divebomb your foes below! But beware: fly too long and your wings will burn up, and taking too much damage may lead to a crash landing. Find this Mythic power across the Island!<br />\n<br />\nYet another Olympian Power is coming your way \u2014 the <strong>Chains of Hades</strong> will pull you in later this Season...</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUnderground in The Underworld: Weapons from Last Season</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike Orpheus looking back at Eurydice, you\u2019re allowed to turn to the weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. Here\u2019s a list of the weapons returning from last Season:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Nemesis AR</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranger Pistol</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMyths &amp; Mods</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thermal Scope and Speedgrip Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thermal-scope-and-speedgrip-mods-1900x600-1fa1cf60430d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s not enough that weapons descended from Olympus \u2014 the <strong>Thermal Scope</strong> and <strong>Speedgrip</strong> weapon mods did too. Also forged by Hephaestus, the Thermal Scope mod can be attached to any scoped weapon. Want vision like that of the gods? It more than doubles the scope view and has a thermal effect you can toggle on or off! With the Speedgrip mod, your movement speed while aiming will increase. Aim true and don\u2019t tarry!<br />\n<br />\nLike last Season, you can find mods at Mod Benches, but this time the benches are in new <strong>Weapons Bunkers</strong>. The bunkers that are unchained will unlock in the middle of the match, when they become ready to raid! If mods aren\u2019t your M.O., Weapons Bunkers also have\u2026 weapons.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Myths Materialize in the Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside Chapter 5 Season 2 comes the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</a>!

The Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass will be available to progress in until May 24, 2024, at 2 AM ET.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nRanked Zero Build - NA Matchmaking Test</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Ranked Zero Build Matchmaking Test\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/ranked-zero-build-matchmaking-test-1920x1080-0db647824423.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nRanked ZB players in North America!<br />\n<br />\nWe\u2019ve heard your feedback about longer queue times at the upper Zero Build ranks. To address this, we\u2019re doing a test! The NA-East and NA-West matchmaking regions will route to the NA-Central matchmaking region <strong>for Ranked Zero Build</strong>. This is so that Ranked Zero Build players in North America will be up against a wider pool of players, which means shorter queue times. The results of this test will determine if this is a long-term solution.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMore Ranked Updates</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Ranked Updates\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/ranked-updates-1920x1080-e0aeab279bda.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe following updates apply to both Ranked Battle Royale and Ranked Zero Build:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>We tweaked progression in the upper ranks to make it harder and more rewarding to reach Unreal.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>Points are no longer granted for surviving without taking damage.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Competitive Notes\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/competitive-notes-1920x1080-ebc8a003d072.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nHave the competitive spirit of Ares?
