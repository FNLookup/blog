The more Power Cells you load, the longer you can drive for.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Power Center\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-power-center-1920x1080-26b4beb564aa.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Power Center.</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Wheels</strong> - Turn in the right direction or give your vehicle an extra push!</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>If your vehicle has <strong>Turnable&nbsp;Wheels</strong> attached, you can use a Driver\u2019s Seat to turn your vehicle. Unlike Turnable&nbsp;Wheels, <strong>Powered Wheels</strong> simply propel your vehicle forward.<br />\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Seats</strong> - For your safety\u2026 and comfort!</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>You\u2019ll need a <strong>Driver\u2019s Seat</strong> (a.k.a. steering wheel\u2026 they\u2019re finally here!) to control and drive your vehicle. Place some extra Seats to take your friends on road trips.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Drivers Seat\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-drivers-seat-1920x1080-bd72f1599418.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Have a seat\u2026 and this picture of one.</em></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHow to Power Vehicles</h2>\n\n<p>Waste not, want not. LEGO\u00ae Fortnite operates on an eco-friendly fuel policy to protect your world\u2019s precious biomes. How? You can recycle your old resources into clean energy with a brand new Station:</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCompost Bin</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Compost Bin\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-compost-bin-1920x1080-f3fc7c7a024f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIs your inventory getting busy? Why throw your old items away when you can put them to good use!<br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Compost Bin</strong> is a new Station that turns resources into <strong>Biomass</strong>, <strong>Fertilizer</strong>, or <strong>Soil</strong>. The number and rarity of what it spits out will depend on what you put in, but you\u2019ll need to create Biomass to unlock the <strong>Power Cell</strong> recipe.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n(One of the ingredients for a Power Cell is Glass. You can now find Glass from bandit camps around your world!)</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nNeed a Tune-Up? Use a Wrench!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Wrench\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-wrench-1920x1080-8dee384de868.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s not just Toys in your toolbox. With a <strong>Wrench</strong>, you can assign Switches and Thrusters to channels, which means you can control as many Thrusters as you\u2019d like using three separate Switches, rather than having one Switch controlling everything. Unlock the recipe for the Wrench by adding a <strong>Wooden Rod</strong> to your inventory.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIlluminate the Dark&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Illuminator\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-illuminator-1920x1080-8719e03365e1.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThis is for all the night drivers out there. Though not a Vehicle Part, the <strong>Illuminator</strong> will add an aura of light to your world in dark areas! Unlock the recipe for the Illuminator by adding a <strong>Thermal Fish</strong> to your inventory and having a <strong>Crafting Bench</strong> in your world.<br />\n<br />\nReady to become a mechanic after reading everything above? It\u2019s okay if you aren\u2019t \u2014 Jules, Comet, and Lynx will steer you in the right direction if you need a hand with vehicles!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMore Updates!</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nRoar</h3>\n\n<p>The suit-wearing tiger <strong>Oscar</strong> joins Jules, Comet, and Lynx as potential new Villagers!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nSweet (...and Spicy?) Treats</h3>\n\n<p>Nothing like dessert after fending off foes. You\u2019ll unlock the recipes for <strong>Ice Cream</strong>, <strong>Snowberry Ice Cream</strong>, and <strong>Spicy Ice Cream</strong> if you add <strong>Snow</strong> to your inventory and have a <strong>Juicer</strong> in your world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements, Adjustments, and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nGameplay</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>New <strong>smart transfer feature</strong>: transfer all similar items to and from storage.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>It's easier to visually tell when your constructs take damage.</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>With the new vehicle building features, we had to adjust some durability values.

Keep Personal Info Private</li>\n</ul>\nPlease take the time to read through these updated rules and familiarize yourself with them.\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nWelcome Fortnite Creator!</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/creative\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Creative</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/starting-out-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite\" target=\"_blank\">Unreal Editor for Fortnite</a> tools allow you to create islands that can be published within Fortnite.<br />\n<br />\nFortnite aims to be a safe and fun place for people to play games or hang with their friends, exactly as we say in our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/community-rules\" target=\"_blank\">Community Rules</a>.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAs you create new islands, games, and experiences within Fortnite, we need your help to keep Fortnite safe, fun, and welcoming to everyone. We also want to make it easy for you to create and be successful with your Fortnite island.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThese rules outline the appropriate ways to create, promote, and monetize your Fortnite island, including some important dos and don\u2019ts. Please take the time to read them carefully before you publish your first Fortnite island and best of luck!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nApplicable Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Whether built using Fortnite or Unreal Editor for Fortnite, your island is your responsibility, and you must comply with the following rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Your <strong>islands</strong> must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/content-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Content Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Your <strong>behavior</strong> must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/community-rules\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Community Rules</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Any <strong>promotion</strong> of your island, both within and outside of Fortnite, must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://brand.epicgames.com/d/KCYRTaiFZuRz\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Creative Branding Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><span id=\"lego-brand-and-creator-rules\">If you choose to use any LEGO\u00ae Templates you must comply with the IP Partner Licensing Agreement and the <a href=\"https://fn.gg/LEGO-Brand-and-Creator-Rules\" target=\"_blank\">LEGO Brand and Creator Rules</a>.</span></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Rules</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"1\">1. Content Rules &amp; Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>As we work together to ensure Fortnite stays a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, your Fortnite content must follow these rules:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.1\">1.1</span> <strong>A Safe Environment</strong> - Don\u2019t create content involving or promoting illegal activities, including the promotion of known real-world gangs or gang violence, the promotion of known real-world terrorist organizations or terrorism, harassment, bullying, assault, doxing, swatting, gambling, illegal drugs, animal cruelty, fraud, hacking, and piracy. Content that condones or incites violence against others has no place in Fortnite. Depictions of or threats of real-world violence will not be tolerated.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.2\">1.2 <strong>Keep Personal Info Private</strong> - To respect privacy and help combat deceptive practices (phishing, buying/selling account information), do not disclose or request personal information anywhere in your island. There is one exception to this rule: You may include your social media handles/channels as long as they don\u2019t include a URL or QR code or a request for direct or private messages. To preserve the privacy of others, you must not gather, share, or exploit the personal information of individuals or organizations through the use of your island, or attempt to. Do not include videos or photographs of real-life people (yourself or others) anywhere in your island or metadata</span><span>&nbsp;(name, description, thumbnail, loading screen text, and/or Discover video).&nbsp;Epic's voice and text chat within Fortnite include protections like privacy settings, parental controls, and player reporting. So don't provide other chat methods on your island, like chat boxes or custom keyboards.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.3\">1.3 <strong>Intolerance and Discrimination </strong>- </span><span>Fortnite welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, and other groups. Content should not demean, dehumanize, marginalize, use hateful language against, perpetuate negative stereotypes about, or belittle other users or groups. Islands that promote or encourage intolerance or discrimination will not be allowed.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.4\">1.4 <strong>Love\u2026 Don\u2019t Hate</strong> - Don\u2019t create content that includes hateful symbols or depictions or content that glorifies or incites violence.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.5\">1.5 <strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong> - Respect others that participate in your creation. Interacting with others in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, abusive,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>or that would cause real-world harm, including extortion, sextortion, and blackmail,&nbsp;is against the rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.6\">1.6 <strong>Be Original</strong> - Keep your creations original. Don't duplicate, copy, or reproduce other creators\u2019 promotional assets such as thumbnails, titles, and/or descriptions. Don\u2019t pass off your creations as another creator\u2019s work, including by using similar game titles, imagery, etc. Don\u2019t impersonate other players, creators, streamers, celebrities, companies, brands, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.7\">1.7 <strong>Respect IP Ownership</strong> - The content you create, publish, or use cannot infringe or violate someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing their copyright or trademark). You must own or have obtained the necessary rights to share and publish the content, and any such license must be broad enough to grant Epic a license consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/eula\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite EULA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-supplemental-terms\" target=\"_self\">UEFN Supplemental Terms</a>. More information about copyright can be found <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/faq_copyright.html\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.8\">1.8 <strong>Give Credit Where It\u2019s Required</strong> - If you use content with a license that requires attribution, like <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_self\">Creative Commons 4.0 International</a>, you must give any required credits, such as by using the \"Attributions\" section in the Creator Portal. Keep in mind that some licenses may not be compatible with this tool or with UEFN. If you're not sure that you can meet the license's attribution requirements, don't use the licensed content.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.9\">1.9 <strong>Play by the Rules</strong> - Do not create islands that promote the use of cheats, exploits, glitched items, server crashes, and bugs. Do not use your island as a way to scam other players.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.10\">1.10 <strong>Appropriate Language Only</strong> - Don\u2019t name your island or include on your island obscene text or symbols, nor spelling variations, or visual depictions of text aimed at evading these rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.11\">1.11 <strong>All Bets Are Off</strong> - Don\u2019t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.12\">1.12 <strong>Keep It on the Island</strong> - Other than social media handles/channels that comply with Rule 1.2, do not include external links or QR codes anywhere on your island.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.13\">1.13 <strong>Keep It Authentic</strong> - When promoting your island inside Fortnite, the assets (such as thumbnail images, lobby backgrounds, or videos) you use to represent your Fortnite island must accurately represent what players will experience in your island; you must not mislead players as to the sort of experience they will have. You may not mention V-Bucks, currency, or rewards. You must not incorporate elements that mislead players with regards to XP gains, in-game items, or Quests. Where Fortnite already provides a visual element to indicate a feature to the players (e.g. the ability to earn XP in your island, or the selection border of a game tile), you must not imitate or supplement it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Thumbnails must adhere to and follow the Thumbnail Image Guidelines for Discover found in the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/thumbnail-image-guidelines-for-discover\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite Creative Documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.14\">1.14 <strong>Stay within Spec Requirements</strong> - Make sure the islands you are creating do not cause server issues, intentionally or not. Frame rates should stay above 30 FPS.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.15\">1.15 <strong>Align with Fortnite\u2019s Game Rating </strong>- Fortnite is a teen-rated title and content that exceeds Fortnite\u2019s rating is not allowed. For example, we don\u2019t permit adult content (no pole dancing). Please refer to the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">IARC Overview</a> for \u201cMaximum Age Ratings in Fortnite.\" We also don't accept content which targets children under 13 as its primary audience (no nursery rhymes). Images and text used to promote your experience must be appropriate for a general audience (e.g. content that would merit a rating of ESRB Everyone 10+, or lower).</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span><span>Content that is suitable for a general audience cannot contain realistic violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, gore, references to gambling or use of strong language. Examples include:</span></span>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Guns pointed at the viewer, and/or depictions of gunfire</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mildly sexualized depictions of a character\u2019s body parts, such as breasts or buttocks</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Images that elicit a strong sense of threat, dread or terror (e.g. grotesque creatures)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Learn more: <a href=\"https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles-guidelines/\" target=\"_self\">ESRB Ratings Principles and Guidelines</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span><span>We require all creators to <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">obtain age ratings</a> for your content via IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) upon publishing. When creating or publishing content for Fortnite, you must also follow these content rules:</span></span></p>\n<span id=\"1.15\"> </span>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\"><span id=\"1.15.1\">1.15.1.&nbsp;<strong>Violence &amp; Gore</strong>: Violence must never be realistic. Death animations and kill replays are not permitted. Realistic gore of any kind is not permitted, including any reference to real or fake blood. Your content may contain horror themes and/or \u201cscary\u201d content, but neither may be intense or sustained. You must avoid disturbing images.</span></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\"><br />\n<span id=\"1.15.2\">1.15.2.&nbsp;<strong>Language</strong>: Use of mild profanity and innuendo is permitted, but must not be frequent.

            "content": "<p>Pandora\u2019s Box has been opened on the Fortnite Battle Royale Island, bringing Olympus to the battlefield. Olympian legends \u2014 including Hades and the thunder god Zeus \u2014 now rule the Island in otherworldly rage. To make matters worse, they\u2019ve brought their powers and weapons with them. Use their mythological means against them in <strong>Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths &amp; Mortals</strong>!</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aOAiUwz7Zt8?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2><br />\nLegendary Locations</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMount Olympus</h3>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t have Olympus without <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>. Home of Zeus, you\u2019ll always feel like you\u2019re being watched with the grand monument that graces this great mountain.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Mount Olympus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-mount-olympus-1920x1080-5537be42c18f.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGrim Gate</h3>\n\n<p>To get to \"The Underworld,\" one way to get there is crossing the river at <strong>Grim Gate</strong>\u2026 where the three-headed guard dog Cerberus awaits. Venture to the west of the Island to confront these canines!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grim Gate\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grim-gate-1920x1080-e353ba2d47e2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nThe Underworld</h3>\n\n<p>Past the hounds is the home of Hades: <strong>The Underworld</strong>. Despite its flowing streams, the land of this city is almost completely dried up.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite The Underworld\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-the-underworld-1920x1080-1a59002a1413.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nBrawler\u2019s Battleground</h3>\n\n<p>The god of war, Ares always welcomes a battle. Take him up on his challenge in the&nbsp;<strong>Brawler\u2019s Battleground</strong> arena south of Mount Olympus. (Oh yeah, Ares will be the Outfit of the April 2024 Crew Pack!)<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Brawler's Battleground\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-brawlers-battleground-1920x1080-28674310ab9a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThese are just some of the locations the gods brought to the Island. However, don\u2019t forget what else they\u2019ve brought with them\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nChaos Upon the Land</h2>\n\n<p>The gods descended with their powers and weapons, but that doesn\u2019t mean your next battle has to end in tragedy. Make your next battle a myth to remember by using them for yourself!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nThunderbolt of Zeus</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thunderbolt of Zeus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thunderbolt-of-zeus-1920x1080-0d46477b195d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nBecome a Storm of your own. With the <strong>Thunderbolt of Zeus</strong>, you can rise into the air and hurl lightning bolts at your target! Use this power wisely though, as the Thunderbolt of Zeus has three maximum charges with a cooldown between each one. How to wield this electricity? Pick up this Mythic power across the Island or by defeating Zeus himself.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGatekeeper Shotgun</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Gatekeeper Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-gatekeeper-shotgun-1920x1080-11ced08de565.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nForged by Hephaestus for Cerberus, the <strong>Gatekeeper Shotgun</strong> can quickly fire three aggressive rounds. This Shotgun is best at short range, so hit all three shots fast to show your bite\u2019s as bad as your bark! When you\u2019re done, prepare for your next target with a full magazine reload. The Gatekeeper Shotgun can be found across the Island, but the Mythic variant is only obtainable from Cerberus rolling over.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHarbinger SMG</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Harbinger SMG\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-harbinger-smg-1920x1080-73e6932eceb0.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nLike Hades himself, the <strong>Harbinger SMG</strong> is unforgiving and relentless \u2014 even when exhausted. Highly accurate when first shot, it has dramatically increased recoil and bloom as more bullets are fired. But that doesn\u2019t stop it from going all out. Find the regular version across the Island or the Mythic version from defeating Hades.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHuntress DMR</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Huntress DMR\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-huntress-dmr-1920x1080-f3544058c0ca.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nArtemis, goddess of the moonlit hunt. During battle, take a note from Artemis and use a weapon created to dole out punishment from a distance. Even though it was created for gods to punish mortals, flip the script and use the <strong>Huntress DMR</strong> to punish the gods (and some mortals too we guess). You can hunt for Huntress DMRs across the Island\u2026 or get the Mythic version by hunting down Zeus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nWarforged Assault Rifle</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Warforged Assault Rifle\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-warforged-assault-rifle-1920x1080-ca546d212315.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Warforged Assault Rifle</strong> is forged for battle-hungry gods \u2014 which is why it\u2019s the favorite of Ares. Powerful yet unruly, this Assault Rifle has high damage, high rate of fire, and strong recoil. Find one across the Island or fight Ares for the Mythic version!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nAnother Power\u2026 the Power of Flight!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Wings of Icarus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-wings-of-icarus-1900x600-f55f15c9f27d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Thunderbolt of Zeus isn\u2019t the only Olympian Power. With the <strong>Wings of Icarus</strong>, soar through the skies and divebomb your foes below! But beware: fly too long and your wings will burn up, and taking too much damage may lead to a crash landing. Find this Mythic power across the Island!<br />\n<br />\nYet another Olympian Power is coming your way \u2014 the <strong>Chains of Hades</strong> will pull you in later this Season...</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUnderground in The Underworld: Weapons from Last Season</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike Orpheus looking back at Eurydice, you\u2019re allowed to turn to the weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. Here\u2019s a list of the weapons returning from last Season:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Nemesis AR</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranger Pistol</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMyths &amp; Mods</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thermal Scope and Speedgrip Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thermal-scope-and-speedgrip-mods-1900x600-1fa1cf60430d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s not enough that weapons descended from Olympus \u2014 the <strong>Thermal Scope</strong> and <strong>Speedgrip</strong> weapon mods did too. Also forged by Hephaestus, the Thermal Scope mod can be attached to any scoped weapon. Want vision like that of the gods? It more than doubles the scope view and has a thermal effect you can toggle on or off! With the Speedgrip mod, your movement speed while aiming will increase. Aim true and don\u2019t tarry!<br />\n<br />\nLike last Season, you can find mods at Mod Benches, but this time the benches are in new <strong>Weapons Bunkers</strong>. The bunkers that are unchained will unlock in the middle of the match, when they become ready to raid! If mods aren\u2019t your M.O., Weapons Bunkers also have\u2026 weapons.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Myths Materialize in the Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside Chapter 5 Season 2 comes the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</a>!
