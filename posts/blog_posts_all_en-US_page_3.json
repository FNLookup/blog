Here are the four main techniques:<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Drift</strong></u><br />\nWhen a sharp turn\u2019s ahead, a well-timed drift can come in clutch. Luckily, Rocket Racing makes basic drifting easy \u2014 all you have to do is make a tight turn! Drifting charges up a speed boost, meaning the longer the drift, the longer the boost will be after you straighten out.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Drift\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-drift-1920x1080-2bdeefb79765.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nAn even sharper turn ahead? That\u2019s when <strong>Rocket Drift</strong> comes in! Activate a Rocket Drift by making a tight turn AND holding the Rocket Drift button. Rocket Drifting can give you the edge in competition by getting you \u2018round the bend first. Like basic drifting, Rocket Drifting charges up a speed boost the longer it\u2019s activated!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Fly</strong></u><br />\nWe all experience bumps on the road, but only rocket-powered cars let you fly over them. The roads of Rocket Racing have lots of <strong>hazards</strong>, and if you hit one, your current speed will slow to make way for passing foes. Avoid hazards by jumping, or holding down the jump button to <em>fly</em>!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly over Hazards\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-over-hazards-1920x1080-ed7b9a03924d.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nSometimes there\u2019s the opposite of bumps on the road: no road at all. And sometimes there\u2019s an alternate path. Whatever your reason for flying, you can hold the jump button for a limited time before the jets run out. Try tapping the jump button in short bursts to fly farther, or recharge entirely by touching the ground.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-1920x1080-a548181ebd56.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong><u>Turbo</u></strong><br />\nBoosting is cool, but how do you go even faster? Going Turbo! All cars in Rocket Racing have a Turbo meter that holds up to three charges. The meter refills over time, and you can make it refill faster by drifting. Use a Turbo immediately or save up all three for a triple Turbo threat!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Turbo\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-turbo-1920x1080-4f6456fabaa9.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Air Dodge (\u201cFlip\u201d)</strong></u><br />\nWhile airborne, air dodge to attach to walls \u2014 or ceilings! Pull off an air dodge by indicating a direction while pressing the air dodge button. Once you\u2019re attached, drift and go Turbo!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Driving on Ceiling\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-driving-on-ceiling-1920x1080-3a6f346d3f73.png\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nPull Up to the Starting Line</h3>\n\n<p>So now that you\u2019re well-versed in rocket-powered cars, it\u2019s time for a high-octane bid to the finish line. But before you finish the race, you gotta start it! Learn how to start racing below:<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Play with Your Party!</strong></u><br />\nWanna play with your party only? In the track selection, adjust the privacy setting to <strong>private</strong> to play unranked races against your party members! Private races support parties of up to 12.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Compete in Public Races!</strong></u><br />\nShow your server region who\u2019s #1! Whether you\u2019re playing solo or in a party, adjust the privacy setting to <strong>public</strong> to play ranked races against opponents not in your party. Public races support parties of up to four.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Choose the Track\u2026 or Let the Track Choose You!</strong></u><br />\nAll 26 launch tracks support 12 opponents. In an unranked session, it\u2019s up to the party leader to choose the track! All 26 tracks are fair game in unranked, including nine <strong>Novice</strong> tracks, seven <strong>Advanced</strong> tracks, and ten <strong>Expert</strong> tracks. Gauge which difficulty is right for your party!<br />\n<br />\nIn a ranked session, the track chooses you.

Rocket Racing Seasons will have their own Ranked Seasons, meaning when Season 1 releases, Season 1 Ranked will also release.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Rank Tiers</strong></u><br />\nThere are eight rank tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. Bronze through Diamond have three ranks, while Elite, Champion, and Unreal have one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Bronze</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Bronze I</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze II</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Silver</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Silver I</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver II</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gold</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Gold I</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold II</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Platinum</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Platinum I</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum II</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Diamond</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Diamond I</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond II</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Champion</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Unreal</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nClimb the ranks of Bronze to reach Silver, then climb the ranks of Silver to reach Gold. Do the same in Gold, Platinum, and Diamond to reach Elite! Once you\u2019re Elite, prove you\u2019re a Champion and then finally Unreal.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Ranked\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-ranked-1920x1080-a22ba507e6df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Reaching Unreal</strong></u><br />\nOnce you reach Unreal, you\u2019ll stay in Unreal for that Ranked Season no matter your performance in future races. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done when you reach Unreal! Upon reaching Unreal, you\u2019ll be given a number signifying your standing among Unreal players globally. Continue doing well in ranked to raise your number and be among the best players in the world! Keep track of your position on the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/ranked/leaderboard\">Unreal leaderboard</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Ranked Journey</strong></u><br />\nLet\u2019s shift to reverse and talk about the journey to Unreal. In ranked play, climb the ranks to unlock more tracks! Once you reach Diamond, you\u2019ll have access to all tracks in ranked.<br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re playing solo, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as you. If you\u2019re playing in a party of more than one, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank of the <em>highest-ranked</em> party member. You\u2019ll also have access to the same number of tracks as the highest-ranked party member.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Rank Reset</strong></u><br />\nAt the start of a new Ranked Season, everyone\u2019s rank will reset to provide a fresh start for all players. Your beginning rank will depend on your finishing rank in the prior Season. Go full-throttle in the current Season for a good start in the next one!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Launch\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-launch-1920x1080-291f57678e49.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Cross-Game-Ownership\"><br />\nCar Customization and Cross-Game Ownership</h2>\n\n<p>Take your favorite Rocket League cars on new adventures! All players have a Locker in Fortnite, and in the \u201cCars\u201d section you can equip a car to use in Rocket Racing.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA Fortnite Car consists of three types of Locker items: Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels. If you own the <strong>Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO&nbsp;</strong>Car Bodies in Rocket League, you also own them in your Fortnite Locker! You also own certain Decals and Wheels you may own in Rocket League. Just make sure you\u2019re playing Fortnite with the same Epic Games account you use to play Rocket League.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Cyclone\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cyclone-3840x2160-af80ea861a9b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Leave caution to the wind with Cyclone.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nWith a Car Body and Wheels, you have all you need for a Car. All players have the <strong>OEM Wheels</strong> in their Locker right now! But what if you don\u2019t own the Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO Car Bodies?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNo worries \u2014 if you don\u2019t have a Car Body in your Locker, you can jump into a Rocket Racing race with a preselected one. And just by completing your first Rocket Racing race before March 26, 2024 ET, you\u2019ll unlock the <strong>Octane Car Body</strong> for your Locker!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Octane\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-octane-3840x2160-1f828678f16f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Octane, a true classic.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nEven if you don\u2019t play Rocket League, you can add even more Car items to your Locker.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nCar items will be available via bundles in the Fortnite Shop, purchasable for <strong>V-Bucks</strong>.

By completing the <strong>Play 10 Rocket Racing races</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Dieselback Pack Back Bling, and by completing the <strong>Reach Gold rank in Rocket Racing</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Jackie Outfit!

Before playing LEGO Fortnite for the first time, you\u2019ll need to <strong>create a new world</strong> or jump into a world a player has made you a <strong>key holder</strong> of.<br />\n<br />\nWhen creating a new world, you\u2019ll choose a save slot to save it to. (You can have up to eight worlds!) Then, you\u2019ll be given some options for enjoying your world your way.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Food\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-food-1920x1080-d20cc3fbf18c.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe most important decision is the <strong>mode</strong> you\u2019ll play. Choose the default <strong>Survival</strong> mode if you want to overcome the world around you. Gather and craft resources for your builds, and face off against mighty foes while exploring the world! Just wanna let your imagination run free? Choose <strong>Sandbox</strong> mode where you can spawn builds and items without needing to find resources.<br />\n<br />\nIf you choose Sandbox mode, you can select options for customizing your world further!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Advanced Settings for Sandbox Mode</strong></u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hunger</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Temperature</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Stamina</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Elimination</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Drop Inventory Upon Elimination</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Friendly Creatures</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Villagers</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n<em>Heads-up!&nbsp;</em>These settings cannot be changed once your world is created, so make sure you double-check what you chose.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nTime to Build!</h3>\n\n<p>When starting out in Survival mode, you\u2019ll want to build a Campfire and shelter to help you survive the first night. After building those, it\u2019s a good idea to build a Crafting Bench! Use the <strong>Crafting Bench</strong> to craft basic tools that\u2019ll make resource gathering quicker.<br />\n<br />\nThe more resources you have, the easier it\u2019ll be to create builds you unlock, including LEGO structures and individual LEGO bricks.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Crafting Bench\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-crafting-bench-1920x1080-1c37af8a8a9d.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Get crackin\u2019 at the Crafting Bench!</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Crafting Bench is just one of many <strong>Stations</strong>. Stations are LEGO builds where you can make things like tools, crafting materials, and food! Another Station is the <strong>Lumber Mill</strong>, which you can use to make Planks for furniture.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Lumber Mill\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-lumber-mill-1920x1080-6563436638f5.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A look at the Lumber Mill!</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nWith enough resources, establish a village by building a <strong>Village Square</strong>. Then develop your village with pre-planned&nbsp;Builds or builds of your own imagination! If you have the resources, you can build what you see on the blueprint.<br />\n<br />\nGoing for a campground feel? Use wood to build a <strong>Log Home</strong>:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Log Home\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-log-home-1920x1080-801538cff605.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Log Shed or Log Cabin not enough? A Jumbo Lodge too much? Then a Log Home\u2019s right for you!</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nGoing for a more medieval feel instead? Use wood <em>and</em> granite to build a <strong>Grand Manor</strong>:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Grand Manor\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-grand-manor-1920x1080-249b37529205.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Hear ye, hear ye.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nDon\u2019t like to build by the book? Use resources to build <strong>Building Parts</strong> like Foundations, Floors, Walls, Roofs, and more. Then make your own distinct build! Whether your build is a pre-planned Build or custom one, decorate it with Furniture like Beds, Tables, and Sofas.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Imagination\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-imagination-1920x1080-770f8fac011d.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Make what you want in LEGO Fortnite.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nStay Intact!</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t let yourself get knocked down. Many things will try to get in your way in your world \u2014 foes, the weather, and even your own hunger.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Enemy\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-enemy-1920x1080-ed620aebf1e5.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nTo face off against foes, craft self-defense tools at a Crafting Bench. To endure the extreme cold or heat, eat certain foods or craft certain <strong>Charms</strong>. To prevent hunger, forage or hunt for food. You can grow your own food too!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Farming\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-farming-1920x1080-f7d673b9639a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nTip: food prevents hunger, but it also recovers hearts. Eat food to stay strong in a battle!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Meters\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-meters-1920x1080-dbe7fb69a5cd.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Keep track of your hunger, temperature, and hearts on your screen.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nPlay with Friends</h3>\n\n<p>Bring other players into your world. LEGO Fortnite supports parties of up to eight players, meaning seven other people can jump into your world while you\u2019re in it!<br />\n<br />\nEveryone wants to rule their own world. You can do that alone, or share the responsibility with friends! Invite up to seven players to be a <strong>key holder</strong> of your world, which means they can access and edit the world anytime. This includes when they\u2019re joining you online or when you\u2019re away offline.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Friends\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-friends-1920x1080-afd9478d15eb.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Invite some friends to hold down the fort.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nTo invite a player to be a key holder, choose a player currently in your world with you. Make this selection in the <strong>Players</strong> tab of the <strong>Map</strong> menu.

To start out, players can transform only one Sports Car per match/gameplay session.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor all the Rocket League fans out there, the OEM Wheels aren\u2019t the only Rocket League item in Fortnite.

There\u2019s also a Car Body in the Battle Pass\u2026</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nScorpion Car Body</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Big Bang Battle Pass</a> has an unlockable Car Body! Give your Sports Car the ready-to-strike <strong>Scorpion</strong>. The Battle Pass also has unlockable Decals for Scorpion\u2019s exterior.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Scorpion Car Body\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-scorpion-car-body-1900x600-2c6895cda548.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGo Ballistic\u2026 Shield</h2>\n\n<p>Enough windshields, now just shields. Pick up a <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> which includes a pistol, then defend yourself with the shield while shooting the pistol at the same time! The Ballistic Shield has infinite Health, but it can only withstand so much damage before it\u2019ll temporarily be knocked from in front of you.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Ballistic Shield\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-ballistic-shield-1900x600-bddba2c7a602.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe shield itself is also a weapon \u2014 charge into enemies to deal damage and knock \u2018em back! Your enemies in hiding? Charge into a building piece to wear it down and make your unwelcome entry.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIsland Arsenal</h2>\n\n<p>The Ballistic Shield is just one of the new weapons in Chapter 5. Want your new suite of SMGs, ARs, and more? Chapter 5 introduces the <strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Nemesis AR</strong>, <strong>Striker&nbsp;AR</strong>, <strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong>, <strong>Hyper SMG</strong>, <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong>, and <strong>Ranger Pistol</strong>:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a-1900x600-28163c9638df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-2\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b-1900x600-c9dd55c8e52e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></div>\n\n<h3><br />\nGrapple Blade</h3>\n\n<p>While others party at Ritzy Riviera, study the blade. Fortunately, the <strong>Grapple Blade</strong> is pretty simple. Aim at a hard surface or another player, then grapple to your target! If you grapple to a player, attack with the blade to deal melee damage. Get enough practice with the Grapple Blade to pull off masterful maneuvers!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grapple Blade\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grapple-blade-1900x600-5da76a13db77.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Also a great mobility item, use a Grapple Blade if there\u2019s no car around.</em></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCluster Clinger</h3>\n\n<p>This explosive explodes explosives. Throw a sticky <strong>Cluster Clinger</strong> on a surface or player, then after a short delay, watch it pop out smaller explosives. Cut and run when someone throws a Cluster.<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Cluster Clinger\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cluster-clinger-1900x600-aff974c8ccec.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nModify Your Weapons</h2>\n\n<p>\u201cCustomize your loadout\u201d now has a whole new meaning. Located in vaults are <strong>Mod Benches</strong>, which have mods available for many weapons in exchange for Bars. Add mods that reduce recoil, increase mag capacity, and more! Save up your Bars wisely, though, as not every mod works with every weapon.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Weapon Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-weapon-mods-1920x1080-487aac1bc121.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou don\u2019t need a Mod Bench to wield a modded weapon. In fact, most mod-compatible weapons are already modded! If it\u2019s of Uncommon rarity, it\u2019ll already have one mod. If it\u2019s of Rare rarity, it\u2019ll have two mods. Epic rarity, three mods. And Legendary, four. If you want different mods than the ones that came with your weapon, you can still replace them at Mod Benches in exchange for Bars. Experiment with different combos to see what\u2019s best for you!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMod-compatible weapons aren\u2019t for sale from Characters or Vending Machines, so keep your eyes <em>peeled</em> for loot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFlow-t On</h2>\n\n<p>The new Island yields a new fruit! Upon consumption, a <strong>FlowBerry</strong> will recover a bit of your and your nearby teammates\u2019 Shield. FlowBerries are best eaten before a jump, as they also grant you and your nearby teammates a temporary low-gravity effect (with fall damage immunity).<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite FlowBerry\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-flowberry-1900x600-2005a7aeb735.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nA Medkit Miracle and Shield Potion Surprise&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Medkits and Shield Potions have changed! Both restore the same amount of stats as before, but the <em>way</em> they do it is different. They now start restoring immediately, and you can now move slowly <em>while</em> they restore. Be a sitting Quackling no more with these two items. But take note: you won't be able to cancel once you start restoring with these items, so use them wisely!<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Medkit and Shield Potion Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-medkit-and-shield-potion-update-1900x600-5adc3972f1d7.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nRevive, Reboot, Thrive&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Reviving and rebooting got a renovation! When you\u2019re reviving a teammate and accidentally move out of range, the revive timer will slowly go down instead of hard reset. Rebooting works the same way \u2014 the reboot timer will slowly go down if you move out of range, not hard reset.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Reviving and Rebooting Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-reviving-and-rebooting-update-1900x600-bbd0c5ec4954.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAlso, only one squad can use each Reboot Van at a time. If a squad eliminates or scares away the current squad, they can continue the current reboot timer to quickly reboot their teammate!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGame, Set, Match Quest</h2>\n\n<p>Besides going for the dub, what goal do you wanna go for in your next match? Chapter 5 Season 1 gives you that choice with <strong>Match Quests</strong>! At the beginning of each match, you\u2019ll be presented a choice of three Match Quests that expire at the end of the match. Match Quests replace Daily Quests to give <em>you</em> the ability to pursue what you want to accomplish while having less distractions in battle.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Match Quests\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-match-quests-1920x1080-40d4b4ad8f35.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMatch Quests are personal to each player, and squadmates cannot contribute to their progress. (Match Quests are tuned to be completable by a single player.) You will have Bonus Goals that reset each day to reward you additional XP for completing Match Quests.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nBuilds to Scale</h2>\n\n<p>There's a new way to scale enemy structures! Walls built by players now have a plank for propelling yourself upwards. Keep an eye out for these planks in the environment too!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nImproved Animations</h2>\n\n<p>Enjoy smoother gameplay thanks to more fluid and detailed animations! Players on all platforms will experience <strong>Motion Matching</strong> and <strong>Procedural Layering</strong> in Fortnite Battle Royale. These are features that result in improved animations for things like transitioning from walking to running, changing directions, and using a weapon.</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 html5-video\">\n<video controls=\"controls\" height=\"auto\" loop=\"loop\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"100%\"><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /></video>\n</div>\n\n<p>Additionally, Fortnite Battle Royale players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC will experience <strong>Physics Based Animation</strong>!

Check out these examples below:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Island ESRB E Rating\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-island-esrb-e-rating-3840x2160-e53285da9369.png\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Note: the rating you see in this image is for illustrative purposes, and may not reflect the rating authority applicable to your region.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Island ESRB T Rating\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-island-esrb-t-rating-3840x2160-a62663ee76d3.png\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Note: the rating you see in this image is for illustrative purposes, and may not reflect the rating authority applicable to your region.</em></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nRatings and Cosmetics</h2>\n\n<p>While there are thousands of Fortnite cosmetics available for all experiences, a small portion are not compatible with E or E10+ (or regionally equivalent) game ratings. In these cases, players will notice a new icon in their Locker and in the Item Shop indicating which Outfits and accessories cannot be equipped inside islands below a certain ratings threshold.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIf a player equips one of these items and joins an island below the designated rating threshold, their equipped item will appear as an item that\u2019s compatible with the island\u2019s rating. (For example, their Outfit will appear as a default Outfit.)<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><em><strong>Update (November 16, 2023):</strong></em><br />\n<em>Today, about 7% of Fortnite Outfits can only be equipped in islands rated Teen (or regional equivalent). Over the next year we will enable most of these Outfits to be compatible with all ratings by having them auto-adjust appearance based on the island you want to play.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"EN 3\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/en-3-2560x1600-decb437ea695.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"EN 4\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/en-4-2560x1600-e80bbbc79f3a.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFor Parents and Guardians</h2>\n\n<p>Parents and guardians can use new options in Epic\u2019s <a href=\"https://safety.epicgames.com/parental-controls\">Parental Controls</a> to set content age rating limits based on their family\u2019s preferences. These controls can be used to prevent their children from playing content above a certain rating. Parents can also unlock specific islands that exceed their ratings threshold, using their Parental Controls PIN.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn the Parental Controls, there\u2019s also an option to turn on/off the ability for children to design their own islands with Fortnite Creative and/or Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN).<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;We hope you find these ratings useful the next time you jump into Fortnite!</p>\n",
