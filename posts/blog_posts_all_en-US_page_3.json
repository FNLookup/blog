            "content": "<p>Hey all!<br />\n<br />\nSince The Big Bang, we\u2019ve cooked up some improvements to Fortnite Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Fortnite Festival. Today\u2019s update hits key areas that we want to address before our next update planned for early 2024.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Battle Royale</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMovement Improvements</h3>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 html5-video\">\n<video class=\"sXBfhcA\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"auto\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"100%\"><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/241015-fnbr-movement-social-clip-en-esrb-blog-aae2d98ffed3.mp4\" /><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/241015-fnbr-movement-social-clip-en-esrb-blog-aae2d98ffed3.mp4\" /></video>\n</div>\n\n<p>Movement speed has been increased when crouching, and running. We also reduced camera movement and adjusted the change in view while sprinting to encourage a smoother experience. Plus, we updated the movement animations to better match the adjustments in speed.<br />\n<br />\nTo help you get adjusted to these updates, we\u2019ve reset everyone\u2019s \u201cCustom Diagonal Movement\u201d settings, so please log in and reconfigure your settings to what feels best.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nMedallions Readability</h3>\n\n<p>Society Medallion icons now stand out more on the map and should be easier to spot at a glance. We also reduced the visual noise present in the minimap when several Medallion zones are near one another, especially in the later Storm circles.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nNight Visibility</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve brightened certain areas of the map where it was a little too dark during night.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nStorm Visibility</h3>\n\n<p>The visibility of the Storm\u2019s edge has been improved so it\u2019s more apparent how close it is, as we heard from the community it could be difficult to see.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nWeapon Icons</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re aware of feedback that the Frenzy Auto Shotgun and the Thunder Burst SMG weapon icons were too similar, making it hard to differentiate them. These icons have been updated to be more visually unique and legible.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRecent Balance Changes</h3>\n\n<p>Last week, we also released a lot of balance changes to Battle Royale. Here\u2019s a recap!</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Flowberries now grant more Shield.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Increased damage for the Ranger Pistol, Shield Breaker EMP, and Ballistic Shield's pistol.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Snowball Launcher mag size reduced.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Thunder Burst SMG mag size increased.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced the drop rate of the Reaper Sniper Rifle.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Striker AR deals less damage.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The circle indicating a Society Medallion holder is smaller.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Society Medallions now have a brief delay before Shield regen begins. They also have slightly reduced regen rates and no longer refill 100% Shield (unless you have all five).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nLEGO Fortnite</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nHungry? More Filling Snacks!</h3>\n\n<p>We heard feedback that food in LEGO Fortnite wasn\u2019t reducing hunger very much, so we made adjustments to make your snacks more filling!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nElimination While Cavin\u2019</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed a bug that might have made you lose your items after being eliminated in the transition between aboveground and belowground. Thanks for your patience as this was being worked on \u2014 we understand it was frustrating to lose your items (we were losing our items too!).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nIn Case You Missed It</h3>\n\n<p>ICYMI, last week we made the following changes before today\u2019s update:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Durability</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The durability of non-Rare/non-Epic tools and weapons has increased by 30%. For Rare/Epic tools and weapons, the durability has increased by 60%!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Damage</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced damage of the Brute\u2019s Poison area for all three Brutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced damage of the Frost Scorpion explosion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Critter Changes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Sand Scorpions, Scorpions found in caves, regular Scorpions, Crabs on the shoreline, Sand Spiders, and Alpine Frost Spiders are slightly easier to defeat.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Rams now give Heavy Wool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Other Tweaks and Improvements&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Grapplers now hold 30 charges.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Spiders won\u2019t jumpscare you as often when turning over rocks.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nRocket Racing</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nLong Queue Times</h3>\n\n<p>We heard feedback that high-ranked racers have been experiencing long queue times in Rocket Racing, and our team is working on incremental improvements to help you get into your races faster. We\u2019ll continue to monitor queue times and make adjustments if necessary.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCar Collisions</h3>\n\n<p>Car-on-car collisions have been a major topic among players, especially when a bump from behind spins your car 180 degrees. Today's update will make those collisions a bit less punishing, and should help keep your car facing the finish line. We\u2019ll continue to work on collision improvements for future updates too.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nJackie Outfit Quest</h3>\n\n<p>The Reach Gold rank in Rocket Racing Quest to unlock the Jackie Outfit was rewarding players for reaching Gold II instead of Gold I. We\u2019ve patched this so that racers who have hit Gold I now just need to complete one full race to complete the Quest and receive the Jackie Outfit.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Festival</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMissing Song Library</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed an error that caused players to see an empty song library in the Main Stage after suspending Fortnite on their device. This should also improve the pauses some players were encountering before a song starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nFall Damage Disabled</h3>\n\n<p>Fall damage has been disabled in the Main Stage\u2019s Backstage. Jump off all the balconies you\u2019d like, rockstars!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRestart Song&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve disabled the \u201cRestart Song\u201d functionality (available to Solo players) temporarily while we fix an error that was causing the game to become unresponsive.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nIncorrect Posting to Leaderboards&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed an issue where some scores may have been posted to the wrong leaderboard. We will continue to monitor (and potentially audit) leaderboards moving forward to ensure their accuracy.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nThis is just the beginning of the future of Fortnite, and we\u2019re excited to continue improvements where possible. Thank you for sharing your feedback \u2014 we appreciate your passion!</p>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Whether you\u2019re playing solo or in a party, select \u201cFestival Main Stage\u201d and get ready for your show! The Main Stage supports parties of up to four players. After selecting this experience, you and your party will enter the Backstage, where you\u2019ll decide who plays lead (Guitar or Keytar), Drums, vocals on the Mic, and Bass. This is also where you\u2019ll decide your setlist!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Your Setlist and Jam Tracks</strong></u><br />\nTo set up your list, go to the organ in the middle of the room. Here, you can add up to four <strong>Jam Tracks</strong> to your setlist! Jam Tracks are songs you can perform in Fortnite Festival, and you can get more Jam Tracks by progressing in the Festival Season Pass or by purchasing them for <strong>V-Bucks</strong> in Fortnite\u2019s Shop. If any one player in your party has a certain Jam Track, you can add that Jam Track to your party\u2019s setlist.<br />\n<br />\nWorried about having no songs in your repertoire? Worry not \u2014 the Main Stage always has a rotation of featured Jam Tracks that you can perform for free for a limited time, even if you don't have them in your Locker.<br />\n<br />\nAlso, all players have the <strong>\u201cOG (Future Remix)\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cShow Them Who We Are\u201d</strong>&nbsp;<em>Lobby Tracks</em> in their Locker right now. These Lobby Tracks double as Jam Tracks you can use in Fortnite Festival. (What\u2019s a Lobby Track?

They\u2019ll also be granted the Jam Track version!<br />\n<br />\n<strong><u>It\u2019s Showtime</u></strong><br />\nWith your setlist decided, hold the \u201cReady Up\u201d option to rift onto the stage! Rock the house by hitting the right notes at the right time, and for those long notes, holding them for the right amount of time. Each song is a test of your reaction skills \u2014 don\u2019t let the crowd down!<br />\n<br />\nThe better you do during a song, the more you\u2019ll fill up the <strong>star meter</strong> which can give you up to five stars per song. Reach for the stars to help you complete <strong>Festival Quests</strong> \u2b50</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nThe Jam Stage</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Festival Jam Stage\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-festival-jam-stage-1920x1080-528c57b51d5e.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nYou don\u2019t need to be <em>the</em> star to have fun. When you\u2019re not breaking a sweat on the Main Stage, create new mixes on the Jam Stage! The Jam Stage supports parties of up to four players \u2014 create mixes with your party or an ensemble of three other players you see onstage.<br />\n<br />\nOnce you\u2019re on the Jam Stage, play the lead loop, Drum loop, Vox (Vocals) loop, or Bass loop of any Jam Track in your Locker. Your band can play loops of up to four different Jam Tracks simultaneously, resulting in new mashups that just might surprise you. Adjust the tempo, key, and major/minor setting to fine tune your mix!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFan of Fortnite Battle Royale? You can also use this <strong>Jam System</strong> to create mixes in a match!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nGather Your Gear</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Festival Instruments\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-festival-instruments-1920x1080-a1135790ba55.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nFortnite Festival introduces new types of Locker items to Fortnite: <strong>Instruments</strong> and <strong>Auras</strong>. (And Jam Tracks!) Instruments are broken down into five kinds: <strong>Guitars</strong>, <strong>Keytars</strong>, <strong>Drums</strong>, <strong>Mics</strong>, and <strong>Basses</strong>. Auras surround you with an ambience as you perform on the Main Stage. <em>Guitars, Keytars, Drums, Mics, Basses, and Auras grant no gameplay advantage as you perform.</em><br />\n<br />\nTo start, you already have one of each Instrument and an Aura in your Locker! Like Jam Tracks, you can get more Instruments and Auras by progressing in a Season\u2019s Pass. You can also get more Instruments by purchasing them for V-Bucks in Fortnite\u2019s Shop.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Stellar Burst Aura\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-stellar-burst-aura-1920x1080-6381b154c04d.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The Stellar Burst Aura, one of the Auras in Fortnite Festival Season 1\u2019s Festival Pass.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThere are more Locker items that Fortnite Festival supports, including Emotes you can perform after your show and Outfits that serve as your melodious avatar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Make-Your-Debut-in-Season-1\"><br />\n\ud83d\udcbf Make Your Debut in Fortnite Festival Season 1: Opening Night</h2>\n\n<p>Fortnite Festival <a href=\"https://fortnite.com/news/fortnite-festival-season-1-opening-night-features-the-weeknd\" target=\"_self\">Season 1: Opening Night</a> starts now, and you\u2019re invited!

During launch week (Dec. 9 at 10 AM ET - Dec 16, 2023, at 10 AM ET), content creators in the <a href=\"https://sac.epicgames.com/overview\">Support-A-Creator (SAC)</a> program will be able to host VOD content on YouTube featuring a <a href=\"#Jam-Track-Selection\" target=\"_self\">selection of Jam Tracks</a> (and their loops) and monetize it. No takedown notifications should occur during this time. More info:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In order to monetize their content featuring the Jam Tracks, SAC members need to link their YouTube and Support-A-Creator accounts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When uploading the content to YouTube, be sure to upload it as Unlisted or Public. If you upload the video as Private, it is possible you could receive a monetization claim on your video.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For uploading the content on other platforms, refer to the channel\u2019s platform policies for tips on how to avoid copyright strikes.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nAlthough unlikely, if you do receive a claim on any SAC content, there may be a short delay in YouTube processing the release of the claim. During this time, please do not dispute the claim.<br />\n<br />\nNot in SAC? Don\u2019t worry, you can still share your Fortnite Festival experiences on YouTube during the launch week featuring the selected Jam Tracks. However, you will not be able to monetize this content on YouTube.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Festival Screenshot 3\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-festival-screenshot-3-1920x1080-fa4b74421ba7.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Please note! \ud83c\udfb5</strong> For Twitch creators streaming content featuring the selected Jam Tracks, we cannot prevent your VODs or clips from getting flagged by third-party copyright detection systems. The general recommendation is to disable VODs/clips when streaming Fortnite Festival. For more information, see Twitch\u2019s <a href=\"https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/dmca-and-copyright-faqs\">DMCA &amp; Copyright FAQs</a> help page.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong id=\"Jam-Track-Selection\">Jam Track Selection</strong></u><br />\nThe selection includes any Jam Track featured in the Shop from December 9 at 10 AM ET to December 16, 2023, at 10 AM ET.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nLicensed Audio Setting and Jam Tracks</h3>\n\n<p>The \"Mute Others\" and \"Mute All\" options for Fortnite's <strong>Licensed Audio</strong> setting mute Jam Tracks. However, the two toggles currently don\u2019t apply to the Main Stage experience, so be careful when streaming or recording Fortnite Festival content.<br />\n<br />\nNon-licensed Jam Tracks are currently muted by the \u201cMute Others\u201d and \u201cMute All\u201d options. We are working to detach non-licensed Jam Tracks from these options in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Festival Screenshot 4\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-festival-screenshot-4-1920x1080-0380d369212c.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThis is just the beginning of the festival, with more songs, artists, and stages coming soon.

Luckily, Rocket Racing makes basic drifting easy \u2014 all you have to do is make a tight turn! Drifting charges up a speed boost, meaning the longer the drift, the longer the boost will be after you straighten out.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Drift\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-drift-1920x1080-2bdeefb79765.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nAn even sharper turn ahead? That\u2019s when <strong>Rocket Drift</strong> comes in! Activate a Rocket Drift by making a tight turn AND holding the Rocket Drift button. Rocket Drifting can give you the edge in competition by getting you \u2018round the bend first. Like basic drifting, Rocket Drifting charges up a speed boost the longer it\u2019s activated!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Fly</strong></u><br />\nWe all experience bumps on the road, but only rocket-powered cars let you fly over them. The roads of Rocket Racing have lots of <strong>hazards</strong>, and if you hit one, your current speed will slow to make way for passing foes. Avoid hazards by jumping, or holding down the jump button to <em>fly</em>!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly over Hazards\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-over-hazards-1920x1080-ed7b9a03924d.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nSometimes there\u2019s the opposite of bumps on the road: no road at all. And sometimes there\u2019s an alternate path. Whatever your reason for flying, you can hold the jump button for a limited time before the jets run out. Try tapping the jump button in short bursts to fly farther, or recharge entirely by touching the ground.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-1920x1080-a548181ebd56.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong><u>Turbo</u></strong><br />\nBoosting is cool, but how do you go even faster? Going Turbo! All cars in Rocket Racing have a Turbo meter that holds up to three charges. The meter refills over time, and you can make it refill faster by drifting. Use a Turbo immediately or save up all three for a triple Turbo threat!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Turbo\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-turbo-1920x1080-4f6456fabaa9.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Air Dodge (\u201cFlip\u201d)</strong></u><br />\nWhile airborne, air dodge to attach to walls \u2014 or ceilings! Pull off an air dodge by indicating a direction while pressing the air dodge button. Once you\u2019re attached, drift and go Turbo!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Driving on Ceiling\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-driving-on-ceiling-1920x1080-3a6f346d3f73.png\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nPull Up to the Starting Line</h3>\n\n<p>So now that you\u2019re well-versed in rocket-powered cars, it\u2019s time for a high-octane bid to the finish line. But before you finish the race, you gotta start it! Learn how to start racing below:<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Play with Your Party!</strong></u><br />\nWanna play with your party only?

Rocket Racing Seasons will have their own Ranked Seasons, meaning when Season 1 releases, Season 1 Ranked will also release.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Rank Tiers</strong></u><br />\nThere are eight rank tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. Bronze through Diamond have three ranks, while Elite, Champion, and Unreal have one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Bronze</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Bronze I</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze II</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Silver</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Silver I</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver II</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gold</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Gold I</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold II</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Platinum</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Platinum I</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum II</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Diamond</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Diamond I</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond II</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Champion</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Unreal</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nClimb the ranks of Bronze to reach Silver, then climb the ranks of Silver to reach Gold. Do the same in Gold, Platinum, and Diamond to reach Elite! Once you\u2019re Elite, prove you\u2019re a Champion and then finally Unreal.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Ranked\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-ranked-1920x1080-a22ba507e6df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Reaching Unreal</strong></u><br />\nOnce you reach Unreal, you\u2019ll stay in Unreal for that Ranked Season no matter your performance in future races. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done when you reach Unreal! Upon reaching Unreal, you\u2019ll be given a number signifying your standing among Unreal players globally. Continue doing well in ranked to raise your number and be among the best players in the world! Keep track of your position on the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/ranked/leaderboard\">Unreal leaderboard</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Ranked Journey</strong></u><br />\nLet\u2019s shift to reverse and talk about the journey to Unreal. In ranked play, climb the ranks to unlock more tracks! Once you reach Diamond, you\u2019ll have access to all tracks in ranked.<br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re playing solo, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as you. If you\u2019re playing in a party of more than one, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank of the <em>highest-ranked</em> party member. You\u2019ll also have access to the same number of tracks as the highest-ranked party member.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Rank Reset</strong></u><br />\nAt the start of a new Ranked Season, everyone\u2019s rank will reset to provide a fresh start for all players. Your beginning rank will depend on your finishing rank in the prior Season. Go full-throttle in the current Season for a good start in the next one!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Launch\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-launch-1920x1080-291f57678e49.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Cross-Game-Ownership\"><br />\nCar Customization and Cross-Game Ownership</h2>\n\n<p>Take your favorite Rocket League cars on new adventures! All players have a Locker in Fortnite, and in the \u201cCars\u201d section you can equip a car to use in Rocket Racing.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA Fortnite Car consists of three types of Locker items: Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels.

By completing the <strong>Play 10 Rocket Racing races</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Dieselback Pack Back Bling, and by completing the <strong>Reach Gold rank in Rocket Racing</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Jackie Outfit!

Before playing LEGO Fortnite for the first time, you\u2019ll need to <strong>create a new world</strong> or jump into a world a player has made you a <strong>key holder</strong> of.<br />\n<br />\nWhen creating a new world, you\u2019ll choose a save slot to save it to. (You can have up to eight worlds!) Then, you\u2019ll be given some options for enjoying your world your way.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Food\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-food-1920x1080-d20cc3fbf18c.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe most important decision is the <strong>mode</strong> you\u2019ll play. Choose the default <strong>Survival</strong> mode if you want to overcome the world around you. Gather and craft resources for your builds, and face off against mighty foes while exploring the world! Just wanna let your imagination run free? Choose <strong>Sandbox</strong> mode where you can spawn builds and items without needing to find resources.<br />\n<br />\nIf you choose Sandbox mode, you can select options for customizing your world further!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Advanced Settings for Sandbox Mode</strong></u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hunger</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Temperature</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Stamina</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Elimination</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Drop Inventory Upon Elimination</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Friendly Creatures</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Villagers</strong>: On or Off</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n<em>Heads-up!&nbsp;</em>These settings cannot be changed once your world is created, so make sure you double-check what you chose.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nTime to Build!</h3>\n\n<p>When starting out in Survival mode, you\u2019ll want to build a Campfire and shelter to help you survive the first night. After building those, it\u2019s a good idea to build a Crafting Bench! Use the <strong>Crafting Bench</strong> to craft basic tools that\u2019ll make resource gathering quicker.<br />\n<br />\nThe more resources you have, the easier it\u2019ll be to create builds you unlock, including LEGO structures and individual LEGO bricks.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Crafting Bench\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-crafting-bench-1920x1080-1c37af8a8a9d.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Get crackin\u2019 at the Crafting Bench!</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe Crafting Bench is just one of many <strong>Stations</strong>. Stations are LEGO builds where you can make things like tools, crafting materials, and food! Another Station is the <strong>Lumber Mill</strong>, which you can use to make Planks for furniture.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Lumber Mill\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-lumber-mill-1920x1080-6563436638f5.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A look at the Lumber Mill!</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nWith enough resources, establish a village by building a <strong>Village Square</strong>. Then develop your village with pre-planned&nbsp;Builds or builds of your own imagination! If you have the resources, you can build what you see on the blueprint.<br />\n<br />\nGoing for a campground feel? Use wood to build a <strong>Log Home</strong>:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Log Home\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-log-home-1920x1080-801538cff605.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Log Shed or Log Cabin not enough? A Jumbo Lodge too much? Then a Log Home\u2019s right for you!</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nGoing for a more medieval feel instead? Use wood <em>and</em> granite to build a <strong>Grand Manor</strong>:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Grand Manor\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-grand-manor-1920x1080-249b37529205.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Hear ye, hear ye.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nDon\u2019t like to build by the book? Use resources to build <strong>Building Parts</strong> like Foundations, Floors, Walls, Roofs, and more. Then make your own distinct build! Whether your build is a pre-planned Build or custom one, decorate it with Furniture like Beds, Tables, and Sofas.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Imagination\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-imagination-1920x1080-770f8fac011d.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Make what you want in LEGO Fortnite.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nStay Intact!</h3>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t let yourself get knocked down. Many things will try to get in your way in your world \u2014 foes, the weather, and even your own hunger.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Enemy\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-enemy-1920x1080-ed620aebf1e5.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nTo face off against foes, craft self-defense tools at a Crafting Bench. To endure the extreme cold or heat, eat certain foods or craft certain <strong>Charms</strong>. To prevent hunger, forage or hunt for food. You can grow your own food too!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Farming\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-farming-1920x1080-f7d673b9639a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nTip: food prevents hunger, but it also recovers hearts. Eat food to stay strong in a battle!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Meters\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-meters-1920x1080-dbe7fb69a5cd.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Keep track of your hunger, temperature, and hearts on your screen.</em><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nPlay with Friends</h3>\n\n<p>Bring other players into your world. LEGO Fortnite supports parties of up to eight players, meaning seven other people can jump into your world while you\u2019re in it!<br />\n<br />\nEveryone wants to rule their own world. You can do that alone, or share the responsibility with friends! Invite up to seven players to be a <strong>key holder</strong> of your world, which means they can access and edit the world anytime. This includes when they\u2019re joining you online or when you\u2019re away offline.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Friends\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-friends-1920x1080-afd9478d15eb.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Invite some friends to hold down the fort.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nTo invite a player to be a key holder, choose a player currently in your world with you. Make this selection in the <strong>Players</strong> tab of the <strong>Map</strong> menu. All party members without a key will be removed from your world when you leave your party or world.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nCustomize Your Character</h3>\n\n<p>There\u2019s customizing your world, but how about customizing yourself?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe characters you play in Fortnite are called <strong>Outfits</strong>, and over 1,200 Outfits have <strong>LEGO Styles</strong>! LEGO Styles are playable in LEGO Fortnite. For example, if you have the Brite Bomber Outfit in your Locker, it\u2019ll appear as a LEGO Style in LEGO Fortnite which you can use to play. LEGO Styles are included with Outfits at no additional cost.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Brite Bomber\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-brite-bomber-1920x1080-f31ebf3e2197.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>LEGO Style of the Brite Bomber Outfit.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nFortnite Outfits also have a <strong>Fortnite Style</strong>, which is usable in other Fortnite experiences.<br />\n<br />\nYou can purchase Outfits in Fortnite\u2019s Shop using <strong>V-Bucks</strong>, but you don\u2019t need to purchase an Outfit to play Fortnite. If you don\u2019t have an Outfit in your Locker, you can jump into LEGO Fortnite with a preselected Outfit!<br />\n<br />\n<em>Heads-up!&nbsp;</em>There are existing <strong>Emotes</strong> you can use with the LEGO Styles of your Outfits. Emotes are items for your Locker you can use to express yourself. They are purchasable in the Shop with V-Bucks, like Outfits.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Start-Your-Adventure-with-the-Explorer-Emilie-Outfit\"><br />\nStart Your Adventure with the Explorer Emilie Outfit</h2>\n\n<p>Wanna explore LEGO Fortnite as an explorer?

Join \u201cThe Underground\u201d and take down The Society\u2019s bosses \u2014 including its most notorious boss Valeria. To help you out, take the Island\u2019s train, modify your weapons, and use a \u201cBallistic Shield\u201d while shooting a pistol.

There\u2019s the chaparral biome in the west, containing the classy <strong>Ritzy Riviera</strong> marina. Looking for something more remote? Venture to the northwest\u2019s boreal forest where the abandoned <strong>Rebel\u2019s Roost</strong> mansion lies.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nDown south in the center of the Island is the grassland biome, whose pristine views are seen by train passengers traveling to Grand Station at <strong>Reckless Railways</strong>. Take the train to get to various parts of the Island!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Train\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-train-1920x1080-a1bb550b3a9e.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThat\u2019s the center and the west, now for the rest. In the east are the boreal tundra and boreal snow biomes, comprising the high alpine <strong>Hazy Hillside</strong> village and elaborate <strong>Grand Glacier Hotel</strong>. Here\u2019s a look at just some of the Island\u2019s locales:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot A\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-a-1920x1080-91f507e691cb.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot B\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-b-1920x1080-971685e5419f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot C\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-c-1920x1080-7be840336661.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot D\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-d-1920x1080-f547b468acc1.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSnow is in more than just the boreal snow biome during the first part of the Season. Fitting for the upcoming <strong>Winterfest 2023</strong>, the boreal forest and boreal tundra are covered in snow too!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHigh Society: Defeat Bosses for Society Medallions</h2>\n\n<p>Across the Island are five bosses: <strong>Oscar</strong>, <strong>Nisha</strong>, <strong>Montague</strong>, <strong>Valeria</strong>, and also&nbsp;<strong>Peter Griffin </strong>from <em>Family Guy</em>. Each boss will drop a <strong>Society Medallion</strong> once defeated. Keep a Medallion in your inventory for your Shield to regenerate over time! The more Society Medallions in your inventory, the more Shield that will regenerate with each tick.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Society Medallions\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-society-medallions-1900x600-6703c4ba2050.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou can\u2019t get to the top without making enemies on the way \u2014 if you have a Society Medallion in your inventory, you\u2019ll be marked on opponents\u2019 map, and the more Medallions you have, the more precise the radius of your exact location.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nForget the Path with the Trailsmasher</h2>\n\n<p>The road too mundane for you? The train too predetermined? Go off-roading with the <strong>Grandeur Trailsmasher</strong> SUV and explore the Island your way!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Trailsmasher\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-trailsmasher-1900x600-88c3cb2592ac.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Don\u2019t take the beaten path, be above it with a luxury ride.</em></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nSpeaking of Cars\u2026</h2>\n\n<p>You\u2019ve equipped Outfits, Back Blings, and more \u2014 now get your engines ready for something new: <strong>Cars</strong>! Give your gameplay cars a fresh new look with this cosmetic category.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCars\u201d is a new section in players\u2019 Lockers. Cars are built with <strong>three new types of Locker items</strong>: Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels. All players have the OEM Wheels from <em>Rocket League</em> in their Locker right now! With a Car Body and Wheels, you have all you need for a Car. <strong>Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels grant no competitive advantage.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite OEM Wheels\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-oem-wheels-1900x600-7cf6b90ced3e.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSo once you have a Car assembled, what do you do with it? Enter a Sports Car in Fortnite Battle Royale or an applicable creator-made island, then watch it turn into your equipped Car! The Sports Car will keep the look of your equipped Car the entire match, even if you exit it and someone else enters it. To start out, players can transform only one Sports Car per match/gameplay session.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor all the Rocket League fans out there, the OEM Wheels aren\u2019t the only Rocket League item in Fortnite. If you own the Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO Car Bodies in Rocket League, you also own them in Fortnite! (Just make sure you\u2019re playing Fortnite with the same Epic Games account you use to play Rocket League.) You also own certain Decals and Wheels you may own in Rocket League.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Octane Car Body\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-octane-car-body-1900x600-e3a1b6b9250e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nCar Bodies will soon be available in the Fortnite Shop via bundles that include other Car items. There\u2019s also a Car Body in the Battle Pass\u2026</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nScorpion Car Body</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Big Bang Battle Pass</a> has an unlockable Car Body! Give your Sports Car the ready-to-strike <strong>Scorpion</strong>. The Battle Pass also has unlockable Decals for Scorpion\u2019s exterior.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Scorpion Car Body\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-scorpion-car-body-1900x600-2c6895cda548.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGo Ballistic\u2026 Shield</h2>\n\n<p>Enough windshields, now just shields. Pick up a <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> which includes a pistol, then defend yourself with the shield while shooting the pistol at the same time! The Ballistic Shield has infinite Health, but it can only withstand so much damage before it\u2019ll temporarily be knocked from in front of you.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Ballistic Shield\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-ballistic-shield-1900x600-bddba2c7a602.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe shield itself is also a weapon \u2014 charge into enemies to deal damage and knock \u2018em back! Your enemies in hiding? Charge into a building piece to wear it down and make your unwelcome entry.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIsland Arsenal</h2>\n\n<p>The Ballistic Shield is just one of the new weapons in Chapter 5. Want your new suite of SMGs, ARs, and more? Chapter 5 introduces the <strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Nemesis AR</strong>, <strong>Striker&nbsp;AR</strong>, <strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong>, <strong>Hyper SMG</strong>, <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong>, and <strong>Ranger Pistol</strong>:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a-1900x600-28163c9638df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-2\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b-1900x600-c9dd55c8e52e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></div>\n\n<h3><br />\nGrapple Blade</h3>\n\n<p>While others party at Ritzy Riviera, study the blade. Fortunately, the <strong>Grapple Blade</strong> is pretty simple. Aim at a hard surface or another player, then grapple to your target! If you grapple to a player, attack with the blade to deal melee damage. Get enough practice with the Grapple Blade to pull off masterful maneuvers!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grapple Blade\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grapple-blade-1900x600-5da76a13db77.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Also a great mobility item, use a Grapple Blade if there\u2019s no car around.</em></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCluster Clinger</h3>\n\n<p>This explosive explodes explosives. Throw a sticky <strong>Cluster Clinger</strong> on a surface or player, then after a short delay, watch it pop out smaller explosives. Cut and run when someone throws a Cluster.<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Cluster Clinger\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cluster-clinger-1900x600-aff974c8ccec.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nModify Your Weapons</h2>\n\n<p>\u201cCustomize your loadout\u201d now has a whole new meaning. Located in vaults are <strong>Mod Benches</strong>, which have mods available for many weapons in exchange for Bars. Add mods that reduce recoil, increase mag capacity, and more! Save up your Bars wisely, though, as not every mod works with every weapon.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Weapon Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-weapon-mods-1920x1080-487aac1bc121.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou don\u2019t need a Mod Bench to wield a modded weapon. In fact, most mod-compatible weapons are already modded! If it\u2019s of Uncommon rarity, it\u2019ll already have one mod. If it\u2019s of Rare rarity, it\u2019ll have two mods. Epic rarity, three mods. And Legendary, four. If you want different mods than the ones that came with your weapon, you can still replace them at Mod Benches in exchange for Bars. Experiment with different combos to see what\u2019s best for you!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMod-compatible weapons aren\u2019t for sale from Characters or Vending Machines, so keep your eyes <em>peeled</em> for loot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFlow-t On</h2>\n\n<p>The new Island yields a new fruit! Upon consumption, a <strong>FlowBerry</strong> will recover a bit of your and your nearby teammates\u2019 Shield. FlowBerries are best eaten before a jump, as they also grant you and your nearby teammates a temporary low-gravity effect (with fall damage immunity).<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite FlowBerry\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-flowberry-1900x600-2005a7aeb735.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nA Medkit Miracle and Shield Potion Surprise&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Medkits and Shield Potions have changed! Both restore the same amount of stats as before, but the <em>way</em> they do it is different. They now start restoring immediately, and you can now move slowly <em>while</em> they restore. Be a sitting Quackling no more with these two items. But take note: you won't be able to cancel once you start restoring with these items, so use them wisely!<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Medkit and Shield Potion Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-medkit-and-shield-potion-update-1900x600-5adc3972f1d7.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nRevive, Reboot, Thrive&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Reviving and rebooting got a renovation! When you\u2019re reviving a teammate and accidentally move out of range, the revive timer will slowly go down instead of hard reset. Rebooting works the same way \u2014 the reboot timer will slowly go down if you move out of range, not hard reset.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Reviving and Rebooting Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-reviving-and-rebooting-update-1900x600-bbd0c5ec4954.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAlso, only one squad can use each Reboot Van at a time. If a squad eliminates or scares away the current squad, they can continue the current reboot timer to quickly reboot their teammate!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGame, Set, Match Quest</h2>\n\n<p>Besides going for the dub, what goal do you wanna go for in your next match? Chapter 5 Season 1 gives you that choice with <strong>Match Quests</strong>! At the beginning of each match, you\u2019ll be presented a choice of three Match Quests that expire at the end of the match. Match Quests replace Daily Quests to give <em>you</em> the ability to pursue what you want to accomplish while having less distractions in battle.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Match Quests\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-match-quests-1920x1080-40d4b4ad8f35.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMatch Quests are personal to each player, and squadmates cannot contribute to their progress. (Match Quests are tuned to be completable by a single player.) You will have Bonus Goals that reset each day to reward you additional XP for completing Match Quests.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nBuilds to Scale</h2>\n\n<p>There's a new way to scale enemy structures! Walls built by players now have a plank for propelling yourself upwards. Keep an eye out for these planks in the environment too!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nImproved Animations</h2>\n\n<p>Enjoy smoother gameplay thanks to more fluid and detailed animations! Players on all platforms will experience <strong>Motion Matching</strong> and <strong>Procedural Layering</strong> in Fortnite Battle Royale. These are features that result in improved animations for things like transitioning from walking to running, changing directions, and using a weapon.</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 html5-video\">\n<video controls=\"controls\" height=\"auto\" loop=\"loop\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"100%\"><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /></video>\n</div>\n\n<p>Additionally, Fortnite Battle Royale players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC will experience <strong>Physics Based Animation</strong>!
