Please see below for a list of balance changes that are included in the v28.10 update:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Enforcer AR</strong> has received a slight increase in bullet speed, damage, and headshot damage (and a reduction in bullet drop). This AR was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong> has received a slight reduction in bullet speed (and an increase in bullet drop), as many Reaper snipes were too easy to land with little counterplay.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Hyper SMG</strong> has received an increase in overall accuracy via tightened bullet spread. Like the Enforcer AR, this SMG was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> has received a slight decrease in damage required to stagger the holder. This loadout option was often too powerful compared to others, especially in Zero Build.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Storm circle speed</strong>, <strong>sprint speed</strong>, and <strong>Energy regeneration</strong> have been reverted to match the same speed from Chapter 4. These reverted&nbsp;speeds better fit the current ideal pace of Fortnite BR.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nWe\u2019ll continue to monitor gameplay data alongside community feedback and make future balance adjustments if necessary.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The EMP Stealth Camo, Cardboard Boxes, and Anvil Rocket Launcher are not included in tournaments.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Fortnite Championship Series 2024 begins soon!

Today\u2019s update hits key areas that we want to address before our next update planned for early 2024.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Battle Royale</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMovement Improvements</h3>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 html5-video\">\n<video class=\"sXBfhcA\" controls=\"controls\" height=\"auto\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"100%\"><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/241015-fnbr-movement-social-clip-en-esrb-blog-aae2d98ffed3.mp4\" /><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/241015-fnbr-movement-social-clip-en-esrb-blog-aae2d98ffed3.mp4\" /></video>\n</div>\n\n<p>Movement speed has been increased when crouching, and running. We also reduced camera movement and adjusted the change in view while sprinting to encourage a smoother experience. Plus, we updated the movement animations to better match the adjustments in speed.<br />\n<br />\nTo help you get adjusted to these updates, we\u2019ve reset everyone\u2019s \u201cCustom Diagonal Movement\u201d settings, so please log in and reconfigure your settings to what feels best.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nMedallions Readability</h3>\n\n<p>Society Medallion icons now stand out more on the map and should be easier to spot at a glance. We also reduced the visual noise present in the minimap when several Medallion zones are near one another, especially in the later Storm circles.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nNight Visibility</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve brightened certain areas of the map where it was a little too dark during night.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nStorm Visibility</h3>\n\n<p>The visibility of the Storm\u2019s edge has been improved so it\u2019s more apparent how close it is, as we heard from the community it could be difficult to see.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nWeapon Icons</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019re aware of feedback that the Frenzy Auto Shotgun and the Thunder Burst SMG weapon icons were too similar, making it hard to differentiate them. These icons have been updated to be more visually unique and legible.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRecent Balance Changes</h3>\n\n<p>Last week, we also released a lot of balance changes to Battle Royale. Here\u2019s a recap!</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Flowberries now grant more Shield.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Increased damage for the Ranger Pistol, Shield Breaker EMP, and Ballistic Shield's pistol.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Snowball Launcher mag size reduced.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Thunder Burst SMG mag size increased.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced the drop rate of the Reaper Sniper Rifle.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Striker AR deals less damage.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The circle indicating a Society Medallion holder is smaller.</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Society Medallions now have a brief delay before Shield regen begins. They also have slightly reduced regen rates and no longer refill 100% Shield (unless you have all five).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nLEGO Fortnite</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nHungry? More Filling Snacks!</h3>\n\n<p>We heard feedback that food in LEGO Fortnite wasn\u2019t reducing hunger very much, so we made adjustments to make your snacks more filling!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nElimination While Cavin\u2019</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed a bug that might have made you lose your items after being eliminated in the transition between aboveground and belowground. Thanks for your patience as this was being worked on \u2014 we understand it was frustrating to lose your items (we were losing our items too!).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nIn Case You Missed It</h3>\n\n<p>ICYMI, last week we made the following changes before today\u2019s update:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Durability</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">The durability of non-Rare/non-Epic tools and weapons has increased by 30%. For Rare/Epic tools and weapons, the durability has increased by 60%!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Damage</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced damage of the Brute\u2019s Poison area for all three Brutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Reduced damage of the Frost Scorpion explosion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Critter Changes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Sand Scorpions, Scorpions found in caves, regular Scorpions, Crabs on the shoreline, Sand Spiders, and Alpine Frost Spiders are slightly easier to defeat.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Rams now give Heavy Wool.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Other Tweaks and Improvements&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Grapplers now hold 30 charges.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">Spiders won\u2019t jumpscare you as often when turning over rocks.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nRocket Racing</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nLong Queue Times</h3>\n\n<p>We heard feedback that high-ranked racers have been experiencing long queue times in Rocket Racing, and our team is working on incremental improvements to help you get into your races faster. We\u2019ll continue to monitor queue times and make adjustments if necessary.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCar Collisions</h3>\n\n<p>Car-on-car collisions have been a major topic among players, especially when a bump from behind spins your car 180 degrees. Today's update will make those collisions a bit less punishing, and should help keep your car facing the finish line. We\u2019ll continue to work on collision improvements for future updates too.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nJackie Outfit Quest</h3>\n\n<p>The Reach Gold rank in Rocket Racing Quest to unlock the Jackie Outfit was rewarding players for reaching Gold II instead of Gold I. We\u2019ve patched this so that racers who have hit Gold I now just need to complete one full race to complete the Quest and receive the Jackie Outfit.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFortnite Festival</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMissing Song Library</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed an error that caused players to see an empty song library in the Main Stage after suspending Fortnite on their device. This should also improve the pauses some players were encountering before a song starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nFall Damage Disabled</h3>\n\n<p>Fall damage has been disabled in the Main Stage\u2019s Backstage. Jump off all the balconies you\u2019d like, rockstars!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRestart Song&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>We\u2019ve disabled the \u201cRestart Song\u201d functionality (available to Solo players) temporarily while we fix an error that was causing the game to become unresponsive.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nIncorrect Posting to Leaderboards&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>We fixed an issue where some scores may have been posted to the wrong leaderboard. We will continue to monitor (and potentially audit) leaderboards moving forward to ensure their accuracy.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nThis is just the beginning of the future of Fortnite, and we\u2019re excited to continue improvements where possible. Thank you for sharing your feedback \u2014 we appreciate your passion!</p>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Here are the four main techniques:<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Drift</strong></u><br />\nWhen a sharp turn\u2019s ahead, a well-timed drift can come in clutch. Luckily, Rocket Racing makes basic drifting easy \u2014 all you have to do is make a tight turn! Drifting charges up a speed boost, meaning the longer the drift, the longer the boost will be after you straighten out.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Drift\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-drift-1920x1080-2bdeefb79765.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nAn even sharper turn ahead? That\u2019s when <strong>Rocket Drift</strong> comes in! Activate a Rocket Drift by making a tight turn AND holding the Rocket Drift button. Rocket Drifting can give you the edge in competition by getting you \u2018round the bend first. Like basic drifting, Rocket Drifting charges up a speed boost the longer it\u2019s activated!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Fly</strong></u><br />\nWe all experience bumps on the road, but only rocket-powered cars let you fly over them. The roads of Rocket Racing have lots of <strong>hazards</strong>, and if you hit one, your current speed will slow to make way for passing foes. Avoid hazards by jumping, or holding down the jump button to <em>fly</em>!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly over Hazards\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-over-hazards-1920x1080-ed7b9a03924d.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nSometimes there\u2019s the opposite of bumps on the road: no road at all. And sometimes there\u2019s an alternate path. Whatever your reason for flying, you can hold the jump button for a limited time before the jets run out. Try tapping the jump button in short bursts to fly farther, or recharge entirely by touching the ground.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-1920x1080-a548181ebd56.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong><u>Turbo</u></strong><br />\nBoosting is cool, but how do you go even faster? Going Turbo! All cars in Rocket Racing have a Turbo meter that holds up to three charges. The meter refills over time, and you can make it refill faster by drifting. Use a Turbo immediately or save up all three for a triple Turbo threat!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Turbo\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-turbo-1920x1080-4f6456fabaa9.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Air Dodge (\u201cFlip\u201d)</strong></u><br />\nWhile airborne, air dodge to attach to walls \u2014 or ceilings! Pull off an air dodge by indicating a direction while pressing the air dodge button. Once you\u2019re attached, drift and go Turbo!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Driving on Ceiling\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-driving-on-ceiling-1920x1080-3a6f346d3f73.png\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nPull Up to the Starting Line</h3>\n\n<p>So now that you\u2019re well-versed in rocket-powered cars, it\u2019s time for a high-octane bid to the finish line. But before you finish the race, you gotta start it! Learn how to start racing below:<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Play with Your Party!</strong></u><br />\nWanna play with your party only? In the track selection, adjust the privacy setting to <strong>private</strong> to play unranked races against your party members! Private races support parties of up to 12.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Compete in Public Races!</strong></u><br />\nShow your server region who\u2019s #1! Whether you\u2019re playing solo or in a party, adjust the privacy setting to <strong>public</strong> to play ranked races against opponents not in your party. Public races support parties of up to four.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Choose the Track\u2026 or Let the Track Choose You!</strong></u><br />\nAll 26 launch tracks support 12 opponents. In an unranked session, it\u2019s up to the party leader to choose the track! All 26 tracks are fair game in unranked, including nine <strong>Novice</strong> tracks, seven <strong>Advanced</strong> tracks, and ten <strong>Expert</strong> tracks. Gauge which difficulty is right for your party!<br />\n<br />\nIn a ranked session, the track chooses you. Learn more about ranked play below \ud83c\udfc1<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Shortcut\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-shortcut-1920x1080-f969fc6903c5.png\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nRace Up the Ranks</h3>\n\n<p>With Season Zero comes <strong>Season Zero Ranked</strong>! Rocket Racing Seasons will have their own Ranked Seasons, meaning when Season 1 releases, Season 1 Ranked will also release.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Rank Tiers</strong></u><br />\nThere are eight rank tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. Bronze through Diamond have three ranks, while Elite, Champion, and Unreal have one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Bronze</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Bronze I</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze II</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Silver</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Silver I</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver II</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gold</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Gold I</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold II</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Platinum</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Platinum I</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum II</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Diamond</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Diamond I</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond II</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Champion</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Unreal</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nClimb the ranks of Bronze to reach Silver, then climb the ranks of Silver to reach Gold. Do the same in Gold, Platinum, and Diamond to reach Elite! Once you\u2019re Elite, prove you\u2019re a Champion and then finally Unreal.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Ranked\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-ranked-1920x1080-a22ba507e6df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Reaching Unreal</strong></u><br />\nOnce you reach Unreal, you\u2019ll stay in Unreal for that Ranked Season no matter your performance in future races. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done when you reach Unreal! Upon reaching Unreal, you\u2019ll be given a number signifying your standing among Unreal players globally. Continue doing well in ranked to raise your number and be among the best players in the world! Keep track of your position on the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/ranked/leaderboard\">Unreal leaderboard</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Ranked Journey</strong></u><br />\nLet\u2019s shift to reverse and talk about the journey to Unreal. In ranked play, climb the ranks to unlock more tracks! Once you reach Diamond, you\u2019ll have access to all tracks in ranked.<br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re playing solo, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as you. If you\u2019re playing in a party of more than one, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank of the <em>highest-ranked</em> party member. You\u2019ll also have access to the same number of tracks as the highest-ranked party member.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Rank Reset</strong></u><br />\nAt the start of a new Ranked Season, everyone\u2019s rank will reset to provide a fresh start for all players. Your beginning rank will depend on your finishing rank in the prior Season. Go full-throttle in the current Season for a good start in the next one!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Launch\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-launch-1920x1080-291f57678e49.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Cross-Game-Ownership\"><br />\nCar Customization and Cross-Game Ownership</h2>\n\n<p>Take your favorite Rocket League cars on new adventures! All players have a Locker in Fortnite, and in the \u201cCars\u201d section you can equip a car to use in Rocket Racing.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA Fortnite Car consists of three types of Locker items: Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels. If you own the <strong>Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO&nbsp;</strong>Car Bodies in Rocket League, you also own them in your Fortnite Locker! You also own certain Decals and Wheels you may own in Rocket League. Just make sure you\u2019re playing Fortnite with the same Epic Games account you use to play Rocket League.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Cyclone\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cyclone-3840x2160-af80ea861a9b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Leave caution to the wind with Cyclone.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nWith a Car Body and Wheels, you have all you need for a Car. All players have the <strong>OEM Wheels</strong> in their Locker right now! But what if you don\u2019t own the Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO Car Bodies?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNo worries \u2014 if you don\u2019t have a Car Body in your Locker, you can jump into a Rocket Racing race with a preselected one. And just by completing your first Rocket Racing race before March 26, 2024 ET, you\u2019ll unlock the <strong>Octane Car Body</strong> for your Locker!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Octane\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-octane-3840x2160-1f828678f16f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Octane, a true classic.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nEven if you don\u2019t play Rocket League, you can add even more Car items to your Locker.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nCar items will be available via bundles in the Fortnite Shop, purchasable for <strong>V-Bucks</strong>.

By completing the <strong>Play 10 Rocket Racing races</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Dieselback Pack Back Bling, and by completing the <strong>Reach Gold rank in Rocket Racing</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Jackie Outfit! Outfits and Back Blings are Locker items that can be used in other experiences inside Fortnite. These two Quests will be available until March 26, 2024 ET.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Season-Zero-and-the-Future\"><br />\nSeason Zero and the Future</h2>\n\n<p>Season Zero\u2019s not even the starting line for Rocket Racing! Exciting updates are boosting in soon, including speed run leaderboards, further customization options, creator-made tracks, and Season 1 planned for early 2024.

But the items for making your Car aren\u2019t just usable in Fortnite \u2014 you can use many in Rocket League too!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWith <strong>cross-game ownership</strong>, you own certain Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels in Fortnite if you already own them in Rocket League, and vice versa. (Just make sure you\u2019re playing Rocket League with the same Epic Games account you use to play Fortnite!) The number of Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels that are shared between Fortnite and Rocket League will grow over time.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Octane\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-octane-1920x1080-db92816bb32f.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nBack Up\u2026 I Can Share Stuff with Rocket League? And Fortnite?</h2>\n\n<p>Yes! During <a href=\"https://fortnite.com/news/race-without-limits-with-rocket-racing-in-fortnite\" target=\"_self\">Rocket Racing\u2019s</a> launch window, The Cyclone and J\u00e4ger 619 Bundles are available for V-Bucks in the Fortnite Shop. After purchasing one of these bundles in Fortnite, you\u2019ll own its contents in Rocket League. Already have them in Rocket League? No need to buy them again in Fortnite!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Cyclone\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cyclone-1920x1080-dcbd64878d9a.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The Cyclone Car Body is included in the Cyclone Bundle, which also includes alternate colors and different Decals.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nRocket Racing isn\u2019t the only way to use Cars in Fortnite. <a href=\"https://fortnite.com/news/join-the-fight-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-underground\">Fortnite Battle Royale</a> and certain creator-made islands have Sports Cars that transform into your Car when you enter them! Ride in style with your personal Car loadout.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite J\u00e4ger 619\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-jager-619-1920x1080-b31964d7c28f.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The J\u00e4ger 619 Car Body is included in the J\u00e4ger 619 Bundle, which also includes alternate colors and different Decals.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nFortnite has its own original Car items. For example, there\u2019s the Scorpion Car Body in the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Big Bang Battle Pass</a>! Even though Scorpion\u2019s not from Rocket League, you may have already noticed it can be shared with Rocket League the same way as Cyclone and J\u00e4ger 619!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Scorpion\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-scorpion-1920x1080-df4e8d0c95e8.png\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Unlock the Scorpion Car Body in the Big Bang Battle Pass plus Decals for the exterior.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nSpeaking of new things, the <strong>Diesel Bundle</strong> is in both the Fortnite and Rocket League Shops during Rocket Racing\u2019s launch window. And yes, if you own the bundle contents in Fortnite, you own them in Rocket League! (And vice versa.) Bring the heat with the new Diesel Car Body.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Diesel\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-diesel-1920x1080-8e792fb54bff.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>The Diesel Car Body is included in the Diesel Bundle, which also includes alternate colors and different Decals.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nAll Fortnite players, whether they\u2019ve played Rocket League or not, have the <strong>OEM Wheels</strong> already in their Locker. More Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels will support cross-game ownership in the future. <strong>Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels grant no competitive advantage.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nWhether it\u2019s Soccar, Sports Car, or Rocket Drift, use your Car items in a variety of ways!</p>\n",
