Just like how Rocket Racing is all about racing without limits, we wanted to treat Rocket Racing development the same way. So with that in mind, we decided not to approach major updates as typical \u201cSeasons.\u201d Instead, we want to introduce themed content while leaving room for features that go beyond the overall theme.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, Neon Rush has neon-themed courses, but also celebrates creator-made tracks and brings the small-town \u201cSlap Happy\u201d track.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThere\u2019s something for everyone in Neon Rush, and we want future major updates to take their own exciting roads!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements, Adjustments, and Bug Fixes</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Rocket Racing Delirium\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-delirium-3840x2160-d157fad32c62.png\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRanked Racing, Matchmaking, and Leaderboards</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranked Progression Balancing</strong>: Alongside the rank reset, we are making adjustments to progress gains in ranked play.

Good luck to everyone playing ranked races, and let us know what you think about the progression changes!</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranked Racing Matchmaking</strong>: With the start of Neon Rush, we\u2019ve made some adjustments to how matchmaking works in ranked play, with the goal of improving queue times for players at all ranks.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Speed Run Leaderboards</strong>: With Neon Rush, the Speed Run leaderboards have been reset.

While making hot new lap times, you can unlock the <strong>Sprintspark Trail</strong> (and its many colors!) with new Quests.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Speed Run Mode\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-speed-run-mode-1920x1080-843f1118be0e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCatch Up on Speed Run</h2>\n\n<p>Ready to prove you\u2019re one of the fastest Rocket Racing drivers? Then get ready because in Speed Run you\u2019ll be up against the toughest opponent of all: the clock.</p>\n\n<p>Try to set the best possible <strong>lap time</strong> on variants of some of your favorite tracks like Riviera, Anaconda, and Olympus. Each match has a countdown timer of several minutes, giving you plenty of time to complete multiple laps (<strong>\u201cruns\u201d</strong>) and create your perfect route to the finish line!<br />\n<br />\nWhile zooming along in Speed Run, don\u2019t be scared when you spot your <strong>ghost</strong>. This not-so-spooky apparition is there to show you exactly how you drove on your best run of the match \u2014 correct its mistakes to shave precious seconds off your lap time.<br />\n<br />\nYou can play Speed Run in either public or private matches. If playing with others, don\u2019t worry about crashing into them. <strong>Player collisions are turned off</strong> in Speed Run so you can focus on your lap times. On the flip side, you can\u2019t catch players\u2019 slipstreams by drafting. Starting line boosts are disabled in this mode as well.<br />\n<br />\nYour fastest run time on a track will be uploaded to that track\u2019s <strong>Season leaderboard</strong> so you see how your skills rack up against drivers worldwide. There\u2019s also a <strong>friends leaderboard </strong>where you can compare your times with your Epic friends for bragging rights! Don\u2019t rest on your laurels, though, as the leaderboards will refresh each Season.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nDue to an issue, the global filters of Season leaderboards are disabled until a future update. We\u2019ll keep you updated when they return. In the meantime, you can still compete with your Epic friends on the friends leaderboards!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nTo access this new mode, simply choose a track in Rocket Racing\u2019s Speed Run row or select the Speed Run playlist with rotating tracks.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nElectrifying Quests!</h2>\n\n<p>All good quests start with a spark! Complete runs in Speed Run to progress in the <strong>Speed Run Kickoff Quests</strong>. By completing the first Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the new <strong>Sprintspark Trail</strong>! Complete the rest of the Quests to unlock 13 paint colors for Sprintspark.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Sprintspark Trail\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-sprintspark-trail-1920x1080-4ce83147114b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will be available until March 26, 2024, at 12 AM ET.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will now be available until April 9, 2024, at 12 AM ET!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nMore Improvements on Mobile</h2>\n\n<p>v28.30 features further enhancements to playing Rocket Racing on mobile:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The touchscreen D-pad has been updated to a touchscreen joystick, allowing for better precision when driving. You can adjust the sensitivity of the joystick in the settings.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We\u2019ve updated the visuals of the mobile HUD.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nDiestro Comes to the Fortnite Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>It might look retro, but the <strong>Diestro Car Body</strong> is all modern power! Take it for a spin in Rocket Racing and other experiences across Fortnite. This Rocket League-original is available in the Shop as part of the <strong>Diestro Car Bundle</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Diestro Car Body (has 13 paint colors)</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Chitchat Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Lozano Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Old Flame Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Sooo Fly Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Stripes Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Stuntman Decal</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Decals in the Diestro Car Bundle can only be equipped with the Diestro Car Body. If you already have Diestro and the Decals in Rocket League, you\u2019ll find them waiting in your Fortnite Locker thanks to <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/news/use-items-across-fortnite-and-rocket-league-with-cross-game-ownership\">cross-game ownership</a>!

The <strong>Xenosplash Boost</strong> comes to the Fortnite ecosystem via the Xenosplash Boost Bundle! This Bundle in the Shop includes the Boost plus 13 different paint colors \ud83c\udfa8<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Xenosplash Boost\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-xenosplash-boost-1920x1080-882ba4d92d34.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re feeling illustrious, consider pairing this Boost with the <strong>Lustrum X10 Wheels</strong> also making their Fortnite debut. These Wheels are available in the Shop via the Lustrum X10 Wheels Bundle, which includes the Wheels and 12 different paint colors!<br />\n<br />\nLike Diestro, the Xenosplash Boost and Lustrum X10 Wheels are eligible for cross-game ownership.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>You can now perform an <strong>Air Roll</strong>!&nbsp;Just hold the left trigger button while midair (or the spacebar on PC) and steer to spin through the air. You can also pair your rolls with your thrusters to fly across the track. We\u2019re looking for feedback on this new advanced mechanic, so let us know what you think.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Various Quests have been adjusted so that they can be progressed by playing Speed Run, Racing, or both! Quest descriptions have also been updated to reflect this.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>Further improvements to collisions while grounded have been made when hitting the environment to prevent getting stuck. We will continue to make improvements as needed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Improved checkpoint crossing times, and exposed one more millisecond digit to the scoreboard for more accurate time tracking.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Increased the minimum speed to demolish in the air when hitting the front of the car, to match the speed required to demolish when grounded (400 KPH).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Achieving a new drift boost while one is already active will now always give you the full impulse for a short duration instead of only making up the difference. This was partially the case in v28.20, but drift boosts that were smaller than the one you had were only 50% as effective.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>While you\u2019re drifting, your wheels should now visually steer more sharply.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You can no longer get bonus speed from a speed pad if your car already has an active stack of bonus speed from that same speed pad. You can still stack bonus speed from multiple different speed pads.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fixed an issue causing cars to sometimes launch backwards when landing an aerial drift after performing a lateral air dodge.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n",

Here are the four main techniques:<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Drift</strong></u><br />\nWhen a sharp turn\u2019s ahead, a well-timed drift can come in clutch. Luckily, Rocket Racing makes basic drifting easy \u2014 all you have to do is make a tight turn! Drifting charges up a speed boost, meaning the longer the drift, the longer the boost will be after you straighten out.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Drift\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-drift-1920x1080-2bdeefb79765.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nAn even sharper turn ahead? That\u2019s when <strong>Rocket Drift</strong> comes in! Activate a Rocket Drift by making a tight turn AND holding the Rocket Drift button. Rocket Drifting can give you the edge in competition by getting you \u2018round the bend first. Like basic drifting, Rocket Drifting charges up a speed boost the longer it\u2019s activated!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Fly</strong></u><br />\nWe all experience bumps on the road, but only rocket-powered cars let you fly over them. The roads of Rocket Racing have lots of <strong>hazards</strong>, and if you hit one, your current speed will slow to make way for passing foes. Avoid hazards by jumping, or holding down the jump button to <em>fly</em>!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly over Hazards\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-over-hazards-1920x1080-ed7b9a03924d.png\" /><br />\n<br />\nSometimes there\u2019s the opposite of bumps on the road: no road at all. And sometimes there\u2019s an alternate path. Whatever your reason for flying, you can hold the jump button for a limited time before the jets run out. Try tapping the jump button in short bursts to fly farther, or recharge entirely by touching the ground.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Fly\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-fly-1920x1080-a548181ebd56.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong><u>Turbo</u></strong><br />\nBoosting is cool, but how do you go even faster? Going Turbo! All cars in Rocket Racing have a Turbo meter that holds up to three charges. The meter refills over time, and you can make it refill faster by drifting. Use a Turbo immediately or save up all three for a triple Turbo threat!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Turbo\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-turbo-1920x1080-4f6456fabaa9.png\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Air Dodge (\u201cFlip\u201d)</strong></u><br />\nWhile airborne, air dodge to attach to walls \u2014 or ceilings! Pull off an air dodge by indicating a direction while pressing the air dodge button. Once you\u2019re attached, drift and go Turbo!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Driving on Ceiling\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-driving-on-ceiling-1920x1080-3a6f346d3f73.png\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3><br />\nPull Up to the Starting Line</h3>\n\n<p>So now that you\u2019re well-versed in rocket-powered cars, it\u2019s time for a high-octane bid to the finish line. But before you finish the race, you gotta start it! Learn how to start racing below:<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Play with Your Party!</strong></u><br />\nWanna play with your party only?

Rocket Racing Seasons will have their own Ranked Seasons, meaning when Season 1 releases, Season 1 Ranked will also release.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Rank Tiers</strong></u><br />\nThere are eight rank tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Champion, and Unreal. Bronze through Diamond have three ranks, while Elite, Champion, and Unreal have one:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Bronze</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Bronze I</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze II</li>\n\t\t<li>Bronze III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Silver</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Silver I</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver II</li>\n\t\t<li>Silver III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Gold</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Gold I</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold II</li>\n\t\t<li>Gold III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Platinum</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Platinum I</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum II</li>\n\t\t<li>Platinum III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Diamond</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Diamond I</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond II</li>\n\t\t<li>Diamond III</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Elite</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Champion</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Unreal</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\nClimb the ranks of Bronze to reach Silver, then climb the ranks of Silver to reach Gold. Do the same in Gold, Platinum, and Diamond to reach Elite! Once you\u2019re Elite, prove you\u2019re a Champion and then finally Unreal.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Ranked\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-ranked-1920x1080-a22ba507e6df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Reaching Unreal</strong></u><br />\nOnce you reach Unreal, you\u2019ll stay in Unreal for that Ranked Season no matter your performance in future races. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done when you reach Unreal! Upon reaching Unreal, you\u2019ll be given a number signifying your standing among Unreal players globally. Continue doing well in ranked to raise your number and be among the best players in the world! Keep track of your position on the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/ranked/leaderboard\">Unreal leaderboard</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>The Ranked Journey</strong></u><br />\nLet\u2019s shift to reverse and talk about the journey to Unreal. In ranked play, climb the ranks to unlock more tracks! Once you reach Diamond, you\u2019ll have access to all tracks in ranked.<br />\n<br />\nIf you\u2019re playing solo, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank as you. If you\u2019re playing in a party of more than one, you\u2019ll be matched against opponents of the same or similar rank of the <em>highest-ranked</em> party member. You\u2019ll also have access to the same number of tracks as the highest-ranked party member.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Rank Reset</strong></u><br />\nAt the start of a new Ranked Season, everyone\u2019s rank will reset to provide a fresh start for all players. Your beginning rank will depend on your finishing rank in the prior Season. Go full-throttle in the current Season for a good start in the next one!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Rocket Racing Launch\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-launch-1920x1080-291f57678e49.png\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Cross-Game-Ownership\"><br />\nCar Customization and Cross-Game Ownership</h2>\n\n<p>Take your favorite Rocket League cars on new adventures! All players have a Locker in Fortnite, and in the \u201cCars\u201d section you can equip a car to use in Rocket Racing.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nA Fortnite Car consists of three types of Locker items: Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels. If you own the <strong>Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO&nbsp;</strong>Car Bodies in Rocket League, you also own them in your Fortnite Locker! You also own certain Decals and Wheels you may own in Rocket League. Just make sure you\u2019re playing Fortnite with the same Epic Games account you use to play Rocket League.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Cyclone\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cyclone-3840x2160-af80ea861a9b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Leave caution to the wind with Cyclone.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nWith a Car Body and Wheels, you have all you need for a Car. All players have the <strong>OEM Wheels</strong> in their Locker right now! But what if you don\u2019t own the Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO Car Bodies?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNo worries \u2014 if you don\u2019t have a Car Body in your Locker, you can jump into a Rocket Racing race with a preselected one. And just by completing your first Rocket Racing race before March 26, 2024 ET, you\u2019ll unlock the <strong>Octane Car Body</strong> for your Locker!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Octane\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-octane-3840x2160-1f828678f16f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Octane, a true classic.</em></p>\n\n<p><br />\nEven if you don\u2019t play Rocket League, you can add even more Car items to your Locker.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nCar items will be available via bundles in the Fortnite Shop, purchasable for <strong>V-Bucks</strong>.

By completing the <strong>Play 10 Rocket Racing races</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Dieselback Pack Back Bling, and by completing the <strong>Reach Gold rank in Rocket Racing</strong> Quest, you\u2019ll unlock the Jackie Outfit! Outfits and Back Blings are Locker items that can be used in other experiences inside Fortnite. These two Quests will be available until March 26, 2024 ET.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"Season-Zero-and-the-Future\"><br />\nSeason Zero and the Future</h2>\n\n<p>Season Zero\u2019s not even the starting line for Rocket Racing!
