Please see below for a list of balance changes that are included in the v28.10 update:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type:disc\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Enforcer AR</strong> has received a slight increase in bullet speed, damage, and headshot damage (and a reduction in bullet drop). This AR was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong> has received a slight reduction in bullet speed (and an increase in bullet drop), as many Reaper snipes were too easy to land with little counterplay.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Hyper SMG</strong> has received an increase in overall accuracy via tightened bullet spread. Like the Enforcer AR, this SMG was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> has received a slight decrease in damage required to stagger the holder. This loadout option was often too powerful compared to others, especially in Zero Build.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Storm circle speed</strong>, <strong>sprint speed</strong>, and <strong>Energy regeneration</strong> have been reverted to match the same speed from Chapter 4. These reverted&nbsp;speeds better fit the current ideal pace of Fortnite BR.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nWe\u2019ll continue to monitor gameplay data alongside community feedback and make future balance adjustments if necessary.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The EMP Stealth Camo, Cardboard Boxes, and Anvil Rocket Launcher are not included in tournaments.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Fortnite Championship Series 2024 begins soon!

Venture to the northwest\u2019s boreal forest where the abandoned <strong>Rebel\u2019s Roost</strong> mansion lies.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nDown south in the center of the Island is the grassland biome, whose pristine views are seen by train passengers traveling to Grand Station at <strong>Reckless Railways</strong>. Take the train to get to various parts of the Island!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Train\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-train-1920x1080-a1bb550b3a9e.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThat\u2019s the center and the west, now for the rest. In the east are the boreal tundra and boreal snow biomes, comprising the high alpine <strong>Hazy Hillside</strong> village and elaborate <strong>Grand Glacier Hotel</strong>. Here\u2019s a look at just some of the Island\u2019s locales:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot A\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-a-1920x1080-91f507e691cb.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot B\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-b-1920x1080-971685e5419f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot C\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-c-1920x1080-7be840336661.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 1 Screenshot D\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-screenshot-d-1920x1080-f547b468acc1.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSnow is in more than just the boreal snow biome during the first part of the Season. Fitting for the upcoming <strong>Winterfest 2023</strong>, the boreal forest and boreal tundra are covered in snow too!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHigh Society: Defeat Bosses for Society Medallions</h2>\n\n<p>Across the Island are five bosses: <strong>Oscar</strong>, <strong>Nisha</strong>, <strong>Montague</strong>, <strong>Valeria</strong>, and also&nbsp;<strong>Peter Griffin </strong>from <em>Family Guy</em>. Each boss will drop a <strong>Society Medallion</strong> once defeated. Keep a Medallion in your inventory for your Shield to regenerate over time! The more Society Medallions in your inventory, the more Shield that will regenerate with each tick.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Society Medallions\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-society-medallions-1900x600-6703c4ba2050.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou can\u2019t get to the top without making enemies on the way \u2014 if you have a Society Medallion in your inventory, you\u2019ll be marked on opponents\u2019 map, and the more Medallions you have, the more precise the radius of your exact location.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nForget the Path with the Trailsmasher</h2>\n\n<p>The road too mundane for you? The train too predetermined? Go off-roading with the <strong>Grandeur Trailsmasher</strong> SUV and explore the Island your way!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Trailsmasher\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-trailsmasher-1900x600-88c3cb2592ac.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Don\u2019t take the beaten path, be above it with a luxury ride.</em></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nSpeaking of Cars\u2026</h2>\n\n<p>You\u2019ve equipped Outfits, Back Blings, and more \u2014 now get your engines ready for something new: <strong>Cars</strong>! Give your gameplay cars a fresh new look with this cosmetic category.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n\u201cCars\u201d is a new section in players\u2019 Lockers. Cars are built with <strong>three new types of Locker items</strong>: Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels. All players have the OEM Wheels from <em>Rocket League</em> in their Locker right now! With a Car Body and Wheels, you have all you need for a Car. <strong>Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels grant no competitive advantage.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite OEM Wheels\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-oem-wheels-1900x600-7cf6b90ced3e.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSo once you have a Car assembled, what do you do with it? Enter a Sports Car in Fortnite Battle Royale or an applicable creator-made island, then watch it turn into your equipped Car! The Sports Car will keep the look of your equipped Car the entire match, even if you exit it and someone else enters it. To start out, players can transform only one Sports Car per match/gameplay session.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor all the Rocket League fans out there, the OEM Wheels aren\u2019t the only Rocket League item in Fortnite. If you own the Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO Car Bodies in Rocket League, you also own them in Fortnite! (Just make sure you\u2019re playing Fortnite with the same Epic Games account you use to play Rocket League.) You also own certain Decals and Wheels you may own in Rocket League.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Octane Car Body\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-octane-car-body-1900x600-e3a1b6b9250e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nCar Bodies will soon be available in the Fortnite Shop via bundles that include other Car items. There\u2019s also a Car Body in the Battle Pass\u2026</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nScorpion Car Body</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Big Bang Battle Pass</a> has an unlockable Car Body! Give your Sports Car the ready-to-strike <strong>Scorpion</strong>. The Battle Pass also has unlockable Decals for Scorpion\u2019s exterior.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Scorpion Car Body\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-scorpion-car-body-1900x600-2c6895cda548.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGo Ballistic\u2026 Shield</h2>\n\n<p>Enough windshields, now just shields. Pick up a <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> which includes a pistol, then defend yourself with the shield while shooting the pistol at the same time! The Ballistic Shield has infinite Health, but it can only withstand so much damage before it\u2019ll temporarily be knocked from in front of you.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Ballistic Shield\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-ballistic-shield-1900x600-bddba2c7a602.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe shield itself is also a weapon \u2014 charge into enemies to deal damage and knock \u2018em back! Your enemies in hiding? Charge into a building piece to wear it down and make your unwelcome entry.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIsland Arsenal</h2>\n\n<p>The Ballistic Shield is just one of the new weapons in Chapter 5. Want your new suite of SMGs, ARs, and more? Chapter 5 introduces the <strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Nemesis AR</strong>, <strong>Striker&nbsp;AR</strong>, <strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong>, <strong>Hyper SMG</strong>, <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong>, and <strong>Ranger Pistol</strong>:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a-1900x600-28163c9638df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-2\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b-1900x600-c9dd55c8e52e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></div>\n\n<h3><br />\nGrapple Blade</h3>\n\n<p>While others party at Ritzy Riviera, study the blade. Fortunately, the <strong>Grapple Blade</strong> is pretty simple. Aim at a hard surface or another player, then grapple to your target! If you grapple to a player, attack with the blade to deal melee damage. Get enough practice with the Grapple Blade to pull off masterful maneuvers!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grapple Blade\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grapple-blade-1900x600-5da76a13db77.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Also a great mobility item, use a Grapple Blade if there\u2019s no car around.</em></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCluster Clinger</h3>\n\n<p>This explosive explodes explosives. Throw a sticky <strong>Cluster Clinger</strong> on a surface or player, then after a short delay, watch it pop out smaller explosives. Cut and run when someone throws a Cluster.<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Cluster Clinger\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cluster-clinger-1900x600-aff974c8ccec.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nModify Your Weapons</h2>\n\n<p>\u201cCustomize your loadout\u201d now has a whole new meaning. Located in vaults are <strong>Mod Benches</strong>, which have mods available for many weapons in exchange for Bars. Add mods that reduce recoil, increase mag capacity, and more! Save up your Bars wisely, though, as not every mod works with every weapon.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Weapon Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-weapon-mods-1920x1080-487aac1bc121.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou don\u2019t need a Mod Bench to wield a modded weapon. In fact, most mod-compatible weapons are already modded! If it\u2019s of Uncommon rarity, it\u2019ll already have one mod. If it\u2019s of Rare rarity, it\u2019ll have two mods. Epic rarity, three mods. And Legendary, four. If you want different mods than the ones that came with your weapon, you can still replace them at Mod Benches in exchange for Bars. Experiment with different combos to see what\u2019s best for you!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMod-compatible weapons aren\u2019t for sale from Characters or Vending Machines, so keep your eyes <em>peeled</em> for loot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFlow-t On</h2>\n\n<p>The new Island yields a new fruit! Upon consumption, a <strong>FlowBerry</strong> will recover a bit of your and your nearby teammates\u2019 Shield. FlowBerries are best eaten before a jump, as they also grant you and your nearby teammates a temporary low-gravity effect (with fall damage immunity).<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite FlowBerry\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-flowberry-1900x600-2005a7aeb735.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nA Medkit Miracle and Shield Potion Surprise&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Medkits and Shield Potions have changed! Both restore the same amount of stats as before, but the <em>way</em> they do it is different. They now start restoring immediately, and you can now move slowly <em>while</em> they restore. Be a sitting Quackling no more with these two items. But take note: you won't be able to cancel once you start restoring with these items, so use them wisely!<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Medkit and Shield Potion Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-medkit-and-shield-potion-update-1900x600-5adc3972f1d7.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nRevive, Reboot, Thrive&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Reviving and rebooting got a renovation! When you\u2019re reviving a teammate and accidentally move out of range, the revive timer will slowly go down instead of hard reset. Rebooting works the same way \u2014 the reboot timer will slowly go down if you move out of range, not hard reset.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Reviving and Rebooting Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-reviving-and-rebooting-update-1900x600-bbd0c5ec4954.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAlso, only one squad can use each Reboot Van at a time. If a squad eliminates or scares away the current squad, they can continue the current reboot timer to quickly reboot their teammate!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGame, Set, Match Quest</h2>\n\n<p>Besides going for the dub, what goal do you wanna go for in your next match? Chapter 5 Season 1 gives you that choice with <strong>Match Quests</strong>! At the beginning of each match, you\u2019ll be presented a choice of three Match Quests that expire at the end of the match. Match Quests replace Daily Quests to give <em>you</em> the ability to pursue what you want to accomplish while having less distractions in battle.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Match Quests\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-match-quests-1920x1080-40d4b4ad8f35.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMatch Quests are personal to each player, and squadmates cannot contribute to their progress. (Match Quests are tuned to be completable by a single player.) You will have Bonus Goals that reset each day to reward you additional XP for completing Match Quests.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nBuilds to Scale</h2>\n\n<p>There's a new way to scale enemy structures! Walls built by players now have a plank for propelling yourself upwards. Keep an eye out for these planks in the environment too!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nImproved Animations</h2>\n\n<p>Enjoy smoother gameplay thanks to more fluid and detailed animations! Players on all platforms will experience <strong>Motion Matching</strong> and <strong>Procedural Layering</strong> in Fortnite Battle Royale. These are features that result in improved animations for things like transitioning from walking to running, changing directions, and using a weapon.</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 html5-video\">\n<video controls=\"controls\" height=\"auto\" loop=\"loop\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"100%\"><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /></video>\n</div>\n\n<p>Additionally, Fortnite Battle Royale players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC will experience <strong>Physics Based Animation</strong>!
