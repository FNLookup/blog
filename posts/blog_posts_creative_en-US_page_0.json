Please take the time to read them carefully before you publish your first Fortnite island and best of luck!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nApplicable Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Whether built using Fortnite or Unreal Editor for Fortnite, your island is your responsibility, and you must comply with the following rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Your <strong>islands</strong> must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/content-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Content Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Your <strong>behavior</strong> must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/community-rules\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Community Rules</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Any <strong>promotion</strong> of your island, both within and outside of Fortnite, must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://brand.epicgames.com/d/KCYRTaiFZuRz\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Creative Branding Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><span id=\"lego-brand-and-creator-rules\">If you choose to use any LEGO\u00ae Templates you must comply with the IP Partner Licensing Agreement and the <a href=\"https://fn.gg/LEGO-Brand-and-Creator-Rules\" target=\"_blank\">LEGO Brand and Creator Rules</a>.</span></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Rules</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"1\">1. Content Rules &amp; Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>As we work together to ensure Fortnite stays a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, your Fortnite content must follow these rules:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.1\">1.1</span> <strong>A Safe Environment</strong> - Don\u2019t create content involving or promoting illegal activities, including the promotion of known real-world gangs or gang violence, the promotion of known real-world terrorist organizations or terrorism, harassment, bullying, assault, doxing, swatting, gambling, illegal drugs, animal cruelty, fraud, hacking, and piracy. Content that condones or incites violence against others has no place in Fortnite. Depictions of or threats of real-world violence will not be tolerated.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.2\">1.2 <strong>Keep Personal Info Private</strong> - To respect privacy and help combat deceptive practices (phishing, buying/selling account information), do not disclose or request personal information anywhere in your island. There is one exception to this rule: You may include your social media handles/channels as long as they don\u2019t include a URL or QR code or a request for direct or private messages. To preserve the privacy of others, you must not gather, share, or exploit the personal information of individuals or organizations through the use of your island, or attempt to. Do not include videos or photographs of real-life people (yourself or others) anywhere in your island or metadata</span><span>&nbsp;(name, description, thumbnail, loading screen text, and/or Discover video).&nbsp;Epic's voice and text chat within Fortnite include protections like privacy settings, parental controls, and player reporting. So don't provide other chat methods on your island, like chat boxes or custom keyboards.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.3\">1.3 <strong>Intolerance and Discrimination </strong>- </span><span>Fortnite welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, and other groups. Content should not demean, dehumanize, marginalize, use hateful language against, perpetuate negative stereotypes about, or belittle other users or groups. Islands that promote or encourage intolerance or discrimination will not be allowed.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.4\">1.4 <strong>Love\u2026 Don\u2019t Hate</strong> - Don\u2019t create content that includes hateful symbols or depictions or content that glorifies or incites violence.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.5\">1.5 <strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong> - Respect others that participate in your creation. Interacting with others in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, abusive,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>or that would cause real-world harm, including extortion, sextortion, and blackmail,&nbsp;is against the rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.6\">1.6 <strong>Be Original</strong> - Keep your creations original. Don't duplicate, copy, or reproduce other creators\u2019 promotional assets such as thumbnails, titles, and/or descriptions. Don\u2019t pass off your creations as another creator\u2019s work, including by using similar game titles, imagery, etc. Don\u2019t impersonate other players, creators, streamers, celebrities, companies, brands, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.7\">1.7 <strong>Respect IP Ownership</strong> - The content you create, publish, or use cannot infringe or violate someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing their copyright or trademark). You must own or have obtained the necessary rights to share and publish the content, and any such license must be broad enough to grant Epic a license consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/eula\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite EULA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-supplemental-terms\" target=\"_self\">UEFN Supplemental Terms</a>. More information about copyright can be found <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/faq_copyright.html\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.8\">1.8 <strong>Give Credit Where It\u2019s Required</strong> - If you use content with a license that requires attribution, like <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_self\">Creative Commons 4.0 International</a>, you must give any required credits, such as by using the \"Attributions\" section in the Creator Portal. Keep in mind that some licenses may not be compatible with this tool or with UEFN. If you're not sure that you can meet the license's attribution requirements, don't use the licensed content.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.9\">1.9 <strong>Play by the Rules</strong> - Do not create islands that promote the use of cheats, exploits, glitched items, server crashes, and bugs. Do not use your island as a way to scam other players.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.10\">1.10 <strong>Appropriate Language Only</strong> - Don\u2019t name your island or include on your island obscene text or symbols, nor spelling variations, or visual depictions of text aimed at evading these rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.11\">1.11 <strong>All Bets Are Off</strong> - Don\u2019t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.12\">1.12 <strong>Keep It on the Island</strong> - Other than social media handles/channels that comply with Rule 1.2, do not include external links or QR codes anywhere on your island.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.13\">1.13 <strong>Keep It Authentic</strong> - When promoting your island inside Fortnite, the assets (such as thumbnail images, lobby backgrounds, or videos) you use to represent your Fortnite island must accurately represent what players will experience in your island; you must not mislead players as to the sort of experience they will have. You may not mention V-Bucks, currency, or rewards. You must not incorporate elements that mislead players with regards to XP gains, in-game items, or Quests. Where Fortnite already provides a visual element to indicate a feature to the players (e.g. the ability to earn XP in your island, or the selection border of a game tile), you must not imitate or supplement it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Thumbnails must adhere to and follow the Thumbnail Image Guidelines for Discover found in the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/thumbnail-image-guidelines-for-discover\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite Creative Documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.14\">1.14 <strong>Stay within Spec Requirements</strong> - Make sure the islands you are creating do not cause server issues, intentionally or not. Frame rates should stay above 30 FPS.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.15\">1.15 <strong>Align with Fortnite\u2019s Game Rating </strong>- Fortnite is a teen-rated title and content that exceeds Fortnite\u2019s rating is not allowed. For example, we don\u2019t permit adult content (no pole dancing). Please refer to the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">IARC Overview</a> for \u201cMaximum Age Ratings in Fortnite.\" We also don't accept content which targets children under 13 as its primary audience (no nursery rhymes). Images and text used to promote your experience must be appropriate for a general audience (e.g. content that would merit a rating of ESRB Everyone 10+, or lower).</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span><span>Content that is suitable for a general audience cannot contain realistic violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, gore, references to gambling or use of strong language. Examples include:</span></span>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Guns pointed at the viewer, and/or depictions of gunfire</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mildly sexualized depictions of a character\u2019s body parts, such as breasts or buttocks</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Images that elicit a strong sense of threat, dread or terror (e.g. grotesque creatures)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Learn more: <a href=\"https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles-guidelines/\" target=\"_self\">ESRB Ratings Principles and Guidelines</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span><span>We require all creators to <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">obtain age ratings</a> for your content via IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) upon publishing.

Working with Others</h3>\n<span id=\"1.14\"> </span>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.14\"><span id=\"2.1\">2.1</span> If you engage another island creator to help you build your experience or, similarly, if you agree to help another island creator create their experience, it is an agreement between you and that person.
