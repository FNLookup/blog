            "content": "<p>Pandora\u2019s Box has been opened on the Fortnite Battle Royale Island, bringing Olympus to the battlefield. Olympian legends \u2014 including Hades and the thunder god Zeus \u2014 now rule the Island in otherworldly rage. To make matters worse, they\u2019ve brought their powers and weapons with them. Use their mythological means against them in <strong>Chapter 5 Season 2: Myths &amp; Mortals</strong>!</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aOAiUwz7Zt8?rel=0\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\n\n<h2><br />\nLegendary Locations</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nMount Olympus</h3>\n\n<p>You can\u2019t have Olympus without <strong>Mount Olympus</strong>. Home of Zeus, you\u2019ll always feel like you\u2019re being watched with the grand monument that graces this great mountain.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Mount Olympus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-mount-olympus-1920x1080-5537be42c18f.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGrim Gate</h3>\n\n<p>To get to \"The Underworld,\" one way to get there is crossing the river at <strong>Grim Gate</strong>\u2026 where the three-headed guard dog Cerberus awaits. Venture to the west of the Island to confront these canines!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grim Gate\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grim-gate-1920x1080-e353ba2d47e2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nThe Underworld</h3>\n\n<p>Past the hounds is the home of Hades: <strong>The Underworld</strong>. Despite its flowing streams, the land of this city is almost completely dried up.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite The Underworld\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-the-underworld-1920x1080-1a59002a1413.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nBrawler\u2019s Battleground</h3>\n\n<p>The god of war, Ares always welcomes a battle. Take him up on his challenge in the&nbsp;<strong>Brawler\u2019s Battleground</strong> arena south of Mount Olympus. (Oh yeah, Ares will be the Outfit of the April 2024 Crew Pack!)<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Brawler's Battleground\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-brawlers-battleground-1920x1080-28674310ab9a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThese are just some of the locations the gods brought to the Island. However, don\u2019t forget what else they\u2019ve brought with them\u2026</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nChaos Upon the Land</h2>\n\n<p>The gods descended with their powers and weapons, but that doesn\u2019t mean your next battle has to end in tragedy. Make your next battle a myth to remember by using them for yourself!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nThunderbolt of Zeus</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thunderbolt of Zeus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thunderbolt-of-zeus-1920x1080-0d46477b195d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nBecome a Storm of your own. With the <strong>Thunderbolt of Zeus</strong>, you can rise into the air and hurl lightning bolts at your target! Use this power wisely though, as the Thunderbolt of Zeus has three maximum charges with a cooldown between each one. How to wield this electricity? Pick up this Mythic power across the Island or by defeating Zeus himself.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGatekeeper Shotgun</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Gatekeeper Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-gatekeeper-shotgun-1920x1080-11ced08de565.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nForged by Hephaestus for Cerberus, the <strong>Gatekeeper Shotgun</strong> can quickly fire three aggressive rounds. This Shotgun is best at short range, so hit all three shots fast to show your bite\u2019s as bad as your bark! When you\u2019re done, prepare for your next target with a full magazine reload. The Gatekeeper Shotgun can be found across the Island, but the Mythic variant is only obtainable from Cerberus rolling over.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHarbinger SMG</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Harbinger SMG\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-harbinger-smg-1920x1080-73e6932eceb0.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nLike Hades himself, the <strong>Harbinger SMG</strong> is unforgiving and relentless \u2014 even when exhausted. Highly accurate when first shot, it has dramatically increased recoil and bloom as more bullets are fired. But that doesn\u2019t stop it from going all out. Find the regular version across the Island or the Mythic version from defeating Hades.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHuntress DMR</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Huntress DMR\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-huntress-dmr-1920x1080-f3544058c0ca.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nArtemis, goddess of the moonlit hunt. During battle, take a note from Artemis and use a weapon created to dole out punishment from a distance. Even though it was created for gods to punish mortals, flip the script and use the <strong>Huntress DMR</strong> to punish the gods (and some mortals too we guess). You can hunt for Huntress DMRs across the Island\u2026 or get the Mythic version by hunting down Zeus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nWarforged Assault Rifle</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Warforged Assault Rifle\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-warforged-assault-rifle-1920x1080-ca546d212315.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Warforged Assault Rifle</strong> is forged for battle-hungry gods \u2014 which is why it\u2019s the favorite of Ares. Powerful yet unruly, this Assault Rifle has high damage, high rate of fire, and strong recoil. Find one across the Island or fight Ares for the Mythic version!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nAnother Power\u2026 the Power of Flight!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Wings of Icarus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-wings-of-icarus-1900x600-f55f15c9f27d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Thunderbolt of Zeus isn\u2019t the only Olympian Power. With the <strong>Wings of Icarus</strong>, soar through the skies and divebomb your foes below! But beware: fly too long and your wings will burn up, and taking too much damage may lead to a crash landing. Find this Mythic power across the Island!<br />\n<br />\nYet another Olympian Power is coming your way \u2014 the <strong>Chains of Hades</strong> will pull you in later this Season...</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUnderground in The Underworld: Weapons from Last Season</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike Orpheus looking back at Eurydice, you\u2019re allowed to turn to the weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. Here\u2019s a list of the weapons returning from last Season:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Nemesis AR</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranger Pistol</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMyths &amp; Mods</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thermal Scope and Speedgrip Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thermal-scope-and-speedgrip-mods-1900x600-1fa1cf60430d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s not enough that weapons descended from Olympus \u2014 the <strong>Thermal Scope</strong> and <strong>Speedgrip</strong> weapon mods did too. Also forged by Hephaestus, the Thermal Scope mod can be attached to any scoped weapon. Want vision like that of the gods? It more than doubles the scope view and has a thermal effect you can toggle on or off! With the Speedgrip mod, your movement speed while aiming will increase. Aim true and don\u2019t tarry!<br />\n<br />\nLike last Season, you can find mods at Mod Benches, but this time the benches are in new <strong>Weapons Bunkers</strong>. The bunkers that are unchained will unlock in the middle of the match, when they become ready to raid! If mods aren\u2019t your M.O., Weapons Bunkers also have\u2026 weapons.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Myths Materialize in the Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside Chapter 5 Season 2 comes the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</a>!

To address this, we\u2019re doing a test! The NA-East and NA-West matchmaking regions will route to the NA-Central matchmaking region <strong>for Ranked Zero Build</strong>. This is so that Ranked Zero Build players in North America will be up against a wider pool of players, which means shorter queue times. The results of this test will determine if this is a long-term solution.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMore Ranked Updates</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Ranked Updates\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/ranked-updates-1920x1080-e0aeab279bda.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe following updates apply to both Ranked Battle Royale and Ranked Zero Build:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>We tweaked progression in the upper ranks to make it harder and more rewarding to reach Unreal.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>Points are no longer granted for surviving without taking damage.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Competitive Notes\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/competitive-notes-1920x1080-ebc8a003d072.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nHave the competitive spirit of Ares?

Like the Enforcer AR, this SMG was lagging and needed a boost to compete with other weapon options.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p>The <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> has received a slight decrease in damage required to stagger the holder. This loadout option was often too powerful compared to others, especially in Zero Build.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\">\n\t<p><strong>Storm circle speed</strong>, <strong>sprint speed</strong>, and <strong>Energy regeneration</strong> have been reverted to match the same speed from Chapter 4. These reverted&nbsp;speeds better fit the current ideal pace of Fortnite BR.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\nWe\u2019ll continue to monitor gameplay data alongside community feedback and make future balance adjustments if necessary.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nCompetitive Notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The EMP Stealth Camo, Cardboard Boxes, and Anvil Rocket Launcher are not included in tournaments.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Fortnite Championship Series 2024 begins soon!

With a Car Body and Wheels, you have all you need for a Car. <strong>Car Bodies, Decals, and Wheels grant no competitive advantage.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite OEM Wheels\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-oem-wheels-1900x600-7cf6b90ced3e.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nSo once you have a Car assembled, what do you do with it? Enter a Sports Car in Fortnite Battle Royale or an applicable creator-made island, then watch it turn into your equipped Car! The Sports Car will keep the look of your equipped Car the entire match, even if you exit it and someone else enters it. To start out, players can transform only one Sports Car per match/gameplay session.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor all the Rocket League fans out there, the OEM Wheels aren\u2019t the only Rocket League item in Fortnite. If you own the Octane, Cyclone, J\u00e4ger 619, or Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n STO Car Bodies in Rocket League, you also own them in Fortnite! (Just make sure you\u2019re playing Fortnite with the same Epic Games account you use to play Rocket League.) You also own certain Decals and Wheels you may own in Rocket League.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Octane Car Body\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-octane-car-body-1900x600-e3a1b6b9250e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nCar Bodies will soon be available in the Fortnite Shop via bundles that include other Car items. There\u2019s also a Car Body in the Battle Pass\u2026</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nScorpion Car Body</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Big Bang Battle Pass</a> has an unlockable Car Body! Give your Sports Car the ready-to-strike <strong>Scorpion</strong>. The Battle Pass also has unlockable Decals for Scorpion\u2019s exterior.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Scorpion Car Body\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-scorpion-car-body-1900x600-2c6895cda548.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGo Ballistic\u2026 Shield</h2>\n\n<p>Enough windshields, now just shields. Pick up a <strong>Ballistic Shield</strong> which includes a pistol, then defend yourself with the shield while shooting the pistol at the same time! The Ballistic Shield has infinite Health, but it can only withstand so much damage before it\u2019ll temporarily be knocked from in front of you.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Ballistic Shield\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-ballistic-shield-1900x600-bddba2c7a602.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe shield itself is also a weapon \u2014 charge into enemies to deal damage and knock \u2018em back! Your enemies in hiding? Charge into a building piece to wear it down and make your unwelcome entry.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIsland Arsenal</h2>\n\n<p>The Ballistic Shield is just one of the new weapons in Chapter 5. Want your new suite of SMGs, ARs, and more? Chapter 5 introduces the <strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong>, <strong>Nemesis AR</strong>, <strong>Striker&nbsp;AR</strong>, <strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong>, <strong>Hyper SMG</strong>, <strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong>, and <strong>Ranger Pistol</strong>:<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"juxtapose\"><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-1\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-a-1900x600-28163c9638df.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><img alt=\"fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b.jpg\" class=\"before-after-slider-2\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-1-new-weapons-b-1900x600-c9dd55c8e52e.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></div>\n\n<h3><br />\nGrapple Blade</h3>\n\n<p>While others party at Ritzy Riviera, study the blade. Fortunately, the <strong>Grapple Blade</strong> is pretty simple. Aim at a hard surface or another player, then grapple to your target! If you grapple to a player, attack with the blade to deal melee damage. Get enough practice with the Grapple Blade to pull off masterful maneuvers!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grapple Blade\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grapple-blade-1900x600-5da76a13db77.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Also a great mobility item, use a Grapple Blade if there\u2019s no car around.</em></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCluster Clinger</h3>\n\n<p>This explosive explodes explosives. Throw a sticky <strong>Cluster Clinger</strong> on a surface or player, then after a short delay, watch it pop out smaller explosives. Cut and run when someone throws a Cluster.<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Cluster Clinger\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-cluster-clinger-1900x600-aff974c8ccec.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nModify Your Weapons</h2>\n\n<p>\u201cCustomize your loadout\u201d now has a whole new meaning. Located in vaults are <strong>Mod Benches</strong>, which have mods available for many weapons in exchange for Bars. Add mods that reduce recoil, increase mag capacity, and more! Save up your Bars wisely, though, as not every mod works with every weapon.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Weapon Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-weapon-mods-1920x1080-487aac1bc121.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou don\u2019t need a Mod Bench to wield a modded weapon. In fact, most mod-compatible weapons are already modded! If it\u2019s of Uncommon rarity, it\u2019ll already have one mod. If it\u2019s of Rare rarity, it\u2019ll have two mods. Epic rarity, three mods. And Legendary, four. If you want different mods than the ones that came with your weapon, you can still replace them at Mod Benches in exchange for Bars. Experiment with different combos to see what\u2019s best for you!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMod-compatible weapons aren\u2019t for sale from Characters or Vending Machines, so keep your eyes <em>peeled</em> for loot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nFlow-t On</h2>\n\n<p>The new Island yields a new fruit! Upon consumption, a <strong>FlowBerry</strong> will recover a bit of your and your nearby teammates\u2019 Shield. FlowBerries are best eaten before a jump, as they also grant you and your nearby teammates a temporary low-gravity effect (with fall damage immunity).<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite FlowBerry\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-flowberry-1900x600-2005a7aeb735.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nA Medkit Miracle and Shield Potion Surprise&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Medkits and Shield Potions have changed! Both restore the same amount of stats as before, but the <em>way</em> they do it is different. They now start restoring immediately, and you can now move slowly <em>while</em> they restore. Be a sitting Quackling no more with these two items. But take note: you won't be able to cancel once you start restoring with these items, so use them wisely!<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"Fortnite Medkit and Shield Potion Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-medkit-and-shield-potion-update-1900x600-5adc3972f1d7.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nRevive, Reboot, Thrive&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Reviving and rebooting got a renovation! When you\u2019re reviving a teammate and accidentally move out of range, the revive timer will slowly go down instead of hard reset. Rebooting works the same way \u2014 the reboot timer will slowly go down if you move out of range, not hard reset.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Reviving and Rebooting Update\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-reviving-and-rebooting-update-1900x600-bbd0c5ec4954.jpg\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nAlso, only one squad can use each Reboot Van at a time. If a squad eliminates or scares away the current squad, they can continue the current reboot timer to quickly reboot their teammate!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nGame, Set, Match Quest</h2>\n\n<p>Besides going for the dub, what goal do you wanna go for in your next match? Chapter 5 Season 1 gives you that choice with <strong>Match Quests</strong>! At the beginning of each match, you\u2019ll be presented a choice of three Match Quests that expire at the end of the match. Match Quests replace Daily Quests to give <em>you</em> the ability to pursue what you want to accomplish while having less distractions in battle.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Match Quests\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-match-quests-1920x1080-40d4b4ad8f35.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nMatch Quests are personal to each player, and squadmates cannot contribute to their progress. (Match Quests are tuned to be completable by a single player.) You will have Bonus Goals that reset each day to reward you additional XP for completing Match Quests.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nBuilds to Scale</h2>\n\n<p>There's a new way to scale enemy structures! Walls built by players now have a plank for propelling yourself upwards. Keep an eye out for these planks in the environment too!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nImproved Animations</h2>\n\n<p>Enjoy smoother gameplay thanks to more fluid and detailed animations! Players on all platforms will experience <strong>Motion Matching</strong> and <strong>Procedural Layering</strong> in Fortnite Battle Royale. These are features that result in improved animations for things like transitioning from walking to running, changing directions, and using a weapon.</p>\n\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 html5-video\">\n<video controls=\"controls\" height=\"auto\" loop=\"loop\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"100%\"><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /><source src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/c5s1-animation-1-20ef5f8c1d0e.mp4\" /></video>\n</div>\n\n<p>Additionally, Fortnite Battle Royale players on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC will experience <strong>Physics Based Animation</strong>!
