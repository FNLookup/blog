Content Rules &amp; Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>As we work together to ensure Fortnite stays a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, your Fortnite content must follow these rules:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.1\">1.1</span> <strong>A Safe Environment</strong> - Don’t create content involving or promoting illegal activities, including the promotion of known real-world gangs or gang violence, the promotion of known real-world terrorist organizations or terrorism, harassment, bullying, assault, doxing, swatting, gambling, illegal drugs, animal cruelty, fraud, hacking, and piracy. Content that condones or incites violence against others has no place in Fortnite. Depictions of or threats of real-world violence will not be tolerated.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.2\">1.2 <strong>Keep Personal Info Private</strong> - To respect privacy and help combat deceptive practices (phishing, buying/selling account information), do not disclose or request personal information anywhere in your island. There is one exception to this rule: You may include your social media handles/channels as long as they don’t include a URL or QR code or a request for direct or private messages. To preserve the privacy of others, you must not gather, share, or exploit the personal information of individuals or organizations through the use of your island, or attempt to. Do not include videos or photographs of people (yourself or others) anywhere in your island or metadata</span><span>&nbsp;(name, description, thumbnail, loading screen text, and/or Discover video).&nbsp;Epic's voice and text chat within Fortnite include protections like privacy settings, parental controls, and player reporting. So don't provide other chat methods on your island, like chat boxes or custom keyboards.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.3\">1.3 <strong>Intolerance and Discrimination </strong>- </span><span>Fortnite welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, and other groups. Content should not demean, dehumanize, marginalize, use hateful language against, perpetuate negative stereotypes about, or belittle other users or groups. Islands that promote or encourage intolerance or discrimination will not be allowed.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.4\">1.4 <strong>Love… Don’t Hate</strong> - Don’t create content that includes hateful symbols or depictions or content that glorifies or incites violence.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.5\">1.5 <strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong> - Respect others that participate in your creation. Interacting with others in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, abusive,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>or that would cause real-world harm, including extortion, sextortion, and blackmail,&nbsp;is against the rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.6\">1.6 <strong>Be Original</strong> - Keep your creations original. Don't duplicate, copy, or reproduce other creators’ promotional assets such as thumbnails, titles, and/or descriptions. Don’t pass off your creations as another creator’s work, including by using similar game titles, imagery, etc. Don’t impersonate other players, creators, streamers, celebrities, companies, brands, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.7\">1.7 <strong>Respect IP Ownership</strong> - The content you create, publish, or use cannot infringe or violate someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing their copyright or trademark). You must own or have obtained the necessary rights to share and publish the content, and any such license must be broad enough to grant Epic a license consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/eula\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite EULA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-supplemental-terms\" target=\"_self\">UEFN Supplemental Terms</a>. More information about copyright can be found <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/faq_copyright.html\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.8\">1.8 <strong>Give Credit Where It’s Required</strong> - If you use content with a license that requires attribution, like <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_self\">Creative Commons 4.0 International</a>, you must give any required credits, such as by using the \"Attributions\" section in the Creator Portal. Keep in mind that some licenses may not be compatible with this tool or with UEFN. If you're not sure that you can meet the license's attribution requirements, don't use the licensed content.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.9\">1.9 <strong>Play by the Rules</strong> - Do not create islands that promote the use of cheats, exploits, glitched items, server crashes, and bugs. Do not use your island as a way to scam other players.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.10\">1.10 <strong>Appropriate Language Only</strong> - Don’t name your island or include on your island obscene text or symbols, nor spelling variations, or visual depictions of text aimed at evading these rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.11\">1.11 <strong>All Bets Are Off</strong> - Don’t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.12\">1.12 <strong>Keep It on the Island</strong> - Other than social media handles/channels that comply with Rule 1.2, do not include external links or QR codes anywhere on your island.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.13\">1.13 <strong>Keep It Authentic</strong> - When promoting your island inside Fortnite, the assets (such as thumbnail images, lobby backgrounds, or videos) you use to represent your Fortnite island must accurately represent what players will experience in your island; you must not mislead players as to the sort of experience they will have. You may not incorporate photographs. You may not mention V-Bucks, currency, or rewards. You must not incorporate elements that mislead players with regards to XP gains, in-game items, or Quests. Where Fortnite already provides a visual element to indicate a feature to the players (e.g. the ability to earn XP in your island, or the selection border of a game tile), you must not imitate or supplement it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Thumbnails must adhere to and follow the Thumbnail Image Guidelines for Discover found in the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/thumbnail-image-guidelines-for-discover\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite Creative Documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.14\">1.14 <strong>Stay within Spec Requirements</strong> - Make sure the islands you are creating do not cause server issues, intentionally or not. Frame rates should stay above 30 FPS.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.15\">1.15 <strong>Align with Fortnite’s Game Rating </strong>- Fortnite is a teen-rated title and content that exceeds Fortnite’s rating is not allowed. For example, we don’t permit adult content (no pole dancing). Please refer to the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">IARC Overview</a> for “Maximum Age Ratings in Fortnite.\" We also don't accept content which targets children under 13 as its primary audience (no nursery rhymes). Images and text used to promote your experience must be appropriate for a general audience (e.g. content that would merit a rating of ESRB Everyone 10+, or lower).</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span><span>Content that is suitable for a general audience cannot contain realistic violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, gore, references to gambling or use of strong language. Examples include:</span></span>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Guns pointed at the viewer, and/or depictions of gunfire</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mildly sexualized depictions of a character’s body parts, such as breasts or buttocks</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Images that elicit a strong sense of threat, dread or terror (e.g. grotesque creatures)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Learn more: <a href=\"https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles-guidelines/\" target=\"_self\">ESRB Ratings Principles and Guidelines</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span><span>We require all creators to <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">obtain age ratings</a> for your content via IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) upon publishing.

Home of Zeus, you’ll always feel like you’re being watched with the grand monument that graces this great mountain.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Mount Olympus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-mount-olympus-1920x1080-5537be42c18f.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGrim Gate</h3>\n\n<p>To get to \"The Underworld,\" one way to get there is crossing the river at <strong>Grim Gate</strong>… where the three-headed guard dog Cerberus awaits. Venture to the west of the Island to confront these canines!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Grim Gate\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-grim-gate-1920x1080-e353ba2d47e2.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nThe Underworld</h3>\n\n<p>Past the hounds is the home of Hades: <strong>The Underworld</strong>. Despite its flowing streams, the land of this city is almost completely dried up.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite The Underworld\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-the-underworld-1920x1080-1a59002a1413.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nBrawler’s Battleground</h3>\n\n<p>The god of war, Ares always welcomes a battle. Take him up on his challenge in the&nbsp;<strong>Brawler’s Battleground</strong> arena south of Mount Olympus. (Oh yeah, Ares will be the Outfit of the April 2024 Crew Pack!)<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Brawler's Battleground\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-brawlers-battleground-1920x1080-28674310ab9a.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThese are just some of the locations the gods brought to the Island. However, don’t forget what else they’ve brought with them…</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nChaos Upon the Land</h2>\n\n<p>The gods descended with their powers and weapons, but that doesn’t mean your next battle has to end in tragedy. Make your next battle a myth to remember by using them for yourself!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nThunderbolt of Zeus</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thunderbolt of Zeus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thunderbolt-of-zeus-1920x1080-0d46477b195d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nBecome a Storm of your own. With the <strong>Thunderbolt of Zeus</strong>, you can rise into the air and hurl lightning bolts at your target! Use this power wisely though, as the Thunderbolt of Zeus has three maximum charges with a cooldown between each one. How to wield this electricity? Pick up this Mythic power across the Island or by defeating Zeus himself.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nGatekeeper Shotgun</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Gatekeeper Shotgun\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-gatekeeper-shotgun-1920x1080-11ced08de565.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nForged by Hephaestus for Cerberus, the <strong>Gatekeeper Shotgun</strong> can quickly fire three aggressive rounds. This Shotgun is best at short range, so hit all three shots fast to show your bite’s as bad as your bark! When you’re done, prepare for your next target with a full magazine reload. The Gatekeeper Shotgun can be found across the Island, but the Mythic variant is only obtainable from Cerberus rolling over.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHarbinger SMG</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Harbinger SMG\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-harbinger-smg-1920x1080-73e6932eceb0.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nLike Hades himself, the <strong>Harbinger SMG</strong> is unforgiving and relentless — even when exhausted. Highly accurate when first shot, it has dramatically increased recoil and bloom as more bullets are fired. But that doesn’t stop it from going all out. Find the regular version across the Island or the Mythic version from defeating Hades.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nHuntress DMR</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Huntress DMR\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-huntress-dmr-1920x1080-f3544058c0ca.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nArtemis, goddess of the moonlit hunt. During battle, take a note from Artemis and use a weapon created to dole out punishment from a distance. Even though it was created for gods to punish mortals, flip the script and use the <strong>Huntress DMR</strong> to punish the gods (and some mortals too we guess). You can hunt for Huntress DMRs across the Island… or get the Mythic version by hunting down Zeus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nWarforged Assault Rifle</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Warforged Assault Rifle\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-warforged-assault-rifle-1920x1080-ca546d212315.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Warforged Assault Rifle</strong> is forged for battle-hungry gods — which is why it’s the favorite of Ares. Powerful yet unruly, this Assault Rifle has high damage, high rate of fire, and strong recoil. Find one across the Island or fight Ares for the Mythic version!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nAnother Power… the Power of Flight!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Wings of Icarus\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-wings-of-icarus-1900x600-f55f15c9f27d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Thunderbolt of Zeus isn’t the only Olympian Power. With the <strong>Wings of Icarus</strong>, soar through the skies and divebomb your foes below! But beware: fly too long and your wings will burn up, and taking too much damage may lead to a crash landing. Find this Mythic power across the Island!<br />\n<br />\nYet another Olympian Power is coming your way — the <strong>Chains of Hades</strong> will pull you in later this Season...</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUnderground in The Underworld: Weapons from Last Season</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike Orpheus looking back at Eurydice, you’re allowed to turn to the weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. Here’s a list of the weapons returning from last Season:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Hammer Pump Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Frenzy Auto Shotgun</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Nemesis AR</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Thunder Burst SMG</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Reaper Sniper Rifle</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranger Pistol</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMyths &amp; Mods</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Fortnite Thermal Scope and Speedgrip Mods\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-thermal-scope-and-speedgrip-mods-1900x600-1fa1cf60430d.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt’s not enough that weapons descended from Olympus — the <strong>Thermal Scope</strong> and <strong>Speedgrip</strong> weapon mods did too. Also forged by Hephaestus, the Thermal Scope mod can be attached to any scoped weapon. Want vision like that of the gods? It more than doubles the scope view and has a thermal effect you can toggle on or off! With the Speedgrip mod, your movement speed while aiming will increase. Aim true and don’t tarry!<br />\n<br />\nLike last Season, you can find mods at Mod Benches, but this time the benches are in new <strong>Weapons Bunkers</strong>. The bunkers that are unchained will unlock in the middle of the match, when they become ready to raid! If mods aren’t your M.O., Weapons Bunkers also have… weapons.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Myths Materialize in the Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</h2>\n\n<p>Alongside Chapter 5 Season 2 comes the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/battle-pass\">Myths &amp; Mortals Battle Pass</a>!

Then get ready because in Speed Run you’ll be up against the toughest opponent of all: the clock.</p>\n\n<p>Try to set the best possible <strong>lap time</strong> on variants of some of your favorite tracks like Riviera, Anaconda, and Olympus. Each match has a countdown timer of several minutes, giving you plenty of time to complete multiple laps (<strong>“runs”</strong>) and create your perfect route to the finish line!<br />\n<br />\nWhile zooming along in Speed Run, don’t be scared when you spot your <strong>ghost</strong>. This not-so-spooky apparition is there to show you exactly how you drove on your best run of the match — correct its mistakes to shave precious seconds off your lap time.<br />\n<br />\nYou can play Speed Run in either public or private matches. If playing with others, don’t worry about crashing into them. <strong>Player collisions are turned off</strong> in Speed Run so you can focus on your lap times. On the flip side, you can’t catch players’ slipstreams by drafting. Starting line boosts are disabled in this mode as well.<br />\n<br />\nYour fastest run time on a track will be uploaded to that track’s <strong>Season leaderboard</strong> so you see how your skills rack up against drivers worldwide. There’s also a <strong>friends leaderboard </strong>where you can compare your times with your Epic friends for bragging rights! Don’t rest on your laurels, though, as the leaderboards will refresh each Season.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nDue to an issue, the global filters of Season leaderboards are disabled until a future update. We’ll keep you updated when they return. In the meantime, you can still compete with your Epic friends on the friends leaderboards!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><br />\nTo access this new mode, simply choose a track in Rocket Racing’s Speed Run row or select the Speed Run playlist with rotating tracks.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nElectrifying Quests!</h2>\n\n<p>All good quests start with a spark! Complete runs in Speed Run to progress in the <strong>Speed Run Kickoff Quests</strong>. By completing the first Quest, you’ll unlock the new <strong>Sprintspark Trail</strong>! Complete the rest of the Quests to unlock 13 paint colors for Sprintspark.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"Fortnite Sprintspark Trail\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-sprintspark-trail-1920x1080-4ce83147114b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will be available until March 26, 2024, at 12 AM ET.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update (March 6, 2024):</strong><br />\nThe Speed Run Kickoff Quests will now be available until April 9, 2024, at 12 AM ET!</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nMore Improvements on Mobile</h2>\n\n<p>v28.30 features further enhancements to playing Rocket Racing on mobile:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The touchscreen D-pad has been updated to a touchscreen joystick, allowing for better precision when driving.

These Wheels are available in the Shop via the Lustrum X10 Wheels Bundle, which includes the Wheels and 12 different paint colors!<br />\n<br />\nLike Diestro, the Xenosplash Boost and Lustrum X10 Wheels are eligible for cross-game ownership.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>You can now perform an <strong>Air Roll</strong>!&nbsp;Just hold the left trigger button while midair (or the spacebar on PC) and steer to spin through the air.

We’re looking for feedback on this new advanced mechanic, so let us know what you think.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Various Quests have been adjusted so that they can be progressed by playing Speed Run, Racing, or both! Quest descriptions have also been updated to reflect this.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n\t<p>Further improvements to collisions while grounded have been made when hitting the environment to prevent getting stuck. We will continue to make improvements as needed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Improved checkpoint crossing times, and exposed one more millisecond digit to the scoreboard for more accurate time tracking.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Increased the minimum speed to demolish in the air when hitting the front of the car, to match the speed required to demolish when grounded (400 KPH).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Achieving a new drift boost while one is already active will now always give you the full impulse for a short duration instead of only making up the difference. This was partially the case in v28.20, but drift boosts that were smaller than the one you had were only 50% as effective.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>While you’re drifting, your wheels should now visually steer more sharply.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You can no longer get bonus speed from a speed pad if your car already has an active stack of bonus speed from that same speed pad. You can still stack bonus speed from multiple different speed pads.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Fixed an issue causing cars to sometimes launch backwards when landing an aerial drift after performing a lateral air dodge.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n","trendingImage":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-speed-run-1900x600-ef1f55823149.jpg","cat":"rocket-racing","sticky":false,"socialWidget":{"cta":{"_type":"Rift Tour CTA","theme":{"_type":"Rift Tour CTA Theme"}},"_type":"Standalone Social Widget","dateColor":"white"},"featured":false,"date":"2024-02-22T10:40:00.000Z","link":"4da6b6b8-0cc1-4d1b-bd4b-662e28b620b9","_id":"4da6b6b8-0cc1-4d1b-bd4b-662e28b620b9","pageMapping":"4da6b6b8-0cc1-4d1b-bd4b-662e28b620b9","slug":"set-a-speed-run-record-in-rocket-racing-v28-30","urlPattern":"/blog/set-a-speed-run-record-in-rocket-racing-v28-30","locale":"en-US","noIndex":false,"_script":"undefined","category":["rocket-racing"],"tags":[],"_metaTags":"<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Rocket Racing Season Zero is speeding up!

During Season 2, content creators in the <a href=\"https://sac.epicgames.com/overview\">Support-A-Creator (SAC)</a> program will be able to host VOD content on YouTube featuring a selection of Jam Tracks and their loops (see below) and monetize it. No takedown notifications should occur during this time. The selection of Jam Tracks will change each week on <strong>Thursdays at 10 AM ET</strong>, so keep checking back to see what’s safe to feature in your streams!<br />\n<br />\nMore info:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In order to monetize their content featuring the Jam Tracks, SAC members need to link their YouTube and Support-A-Creator accounts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When uploading the content to YouTube, be sure to upload it as Unlisted or Public.
