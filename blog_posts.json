The <strong>Werewolf Car Body</strong> breaks away from the wolf pack, tracking its prey from Rocket League all the way to Fortnite! If you have Werewolf in Rocket League, you now have it in Fortnite thanks to cross-game ownership.<br />\n<br />\nIf you’re not a Werewolf owner, you can follow the scent to the Werewolf Bundle available in the Fortnite Shop now.

Just like how Rocket Racing is all about racing without limits, we wanted to treat Rocket Racing development the same way. So with that in mind, we decided not to approach major updates as typical “Seasons.” Instead, we want to introduce themed content while leaving room for features that go beyond the overall theme.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, Neon Rush has neon-themed courses, but also celebrates creator-made tracks and brings the small-town “Slap Happy” track.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThere’s something for everyone in Neon Rush, and we want future major updates to take their own exciting roads!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements, Adjustments, and Bug Fixes</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Rocket Racing Delirium\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/rocket-racing-delirium-3840x2160-d157fad32c62.png\" /></p>\n\n<h3><br />\nRanked Racing, Matchmaking, and Leaderboards</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Ranked Progression Balancing</strong>: Alongside the rank reset, we are making adjustments to progress gains in ranked play.

The <strong>Scurvy Shoals</strong> Venture Season has come ashore in Save the World, and brings <strong>Survive the Horde</strong> back into the fray with tons of updates and improvements. Let's take a look!<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"24BR HordeMode 1 Social\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/24br-hordemode-1-social-1920x1080-16d1f49b98b8.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHot Map Update</h2>\n\n<p>In the latest edition of Survive the Horde, you won’t always be moving to the same bases as before. For example, a new base location has appeared at the Volcano!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAlso, the gnome rave from last time got broken up, so they’ve found a new place to party.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nWave Updates</h2>\n\n<p>We updated the balance and order of waves in Survive the Horde, and added some new ones for you to discover.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAlso, as wave difficulty increases, you’ll also have less time between waves to prepare — so don’t dally!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nFinal Wave Holdout</h3>\n\n<p>Get ready for the grand finale… There’s now a <strong>“final wave”</strong>! Survive the horde for five minutes at the end of a mission while you wait for Homebase to pull you out.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nUnlock Difficulty Tiers</h2>\n\n<p>Survive The Horde now has multiple difficulty tiers. Complete a tier, and the next difficulty will unlock. Can you overcome Tier 5?<br />\n<br />\nUnlock new Banner Icons and Sprays as you complete these difficulties!<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nChallenge Week Schedule</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve adjusted the order of Challenge Weeks compared to Survive The Horde’s debut run, and added some more. Here’s a breakdown of what to expect week-to-week this Venture Season!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nChallenge Week 1 - Storm Surge</h3>\n\n<p>The safe zones within the Storm are now smaller. Lightning strikes frequently target the team, giving players and Husks alike a nasty zap!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 2 - Low Gravity</h3>\n\n<p>The magnetic field has shifted, rendering Hoverboards inoperable and changing the effects of gravity. Jump higher and move faster as your melee attacks knock back the hordes of Husks.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 3 - Melee Mayhem</h3>\n\n<p>Ranged weapons and ammo from Supply Drops are limited, and any ranged attacks made against Husks will ricochet off and also damage you. But on the bright side, your Trap damage and melee attack speed will be boosted, so put away those guns, craft some extra Traps, and start swingin’!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 4 - Hasty Husks</h3>\n\n<p>You’re in a jam: damaging and eliminating enemies will just make the horde move in more quickly. Even worse, if they get close enough to start damaging you, they’ll start healing themselves! Focus fire to try to take them out quickly (and preferably at a distance).</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 5 - Windswept</h3>\n\n<p>Hold onto your hats! It’s getting gusty out here, threatening players with a rash of tornadoes.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 6 - Slow Burn&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Feel the burn as Husks drop an acid pool after being eliminated. Beware of the Husks’ attacks inflicting you with a slowing status effect, making avoiding the acid pools tricky!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 7 - Unflappable Husks&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The Horde has become unstoppable, ignoring all crowd control effects. Try and avoid their attacks as they now leave a lingering damage effect when they hit you! To help you out, your Sniper, Assault Rifle, SMG, Shotgun, and Pistol damage have been increased, and Traps have become more lethal. Use your newfound power to keep the Horde at bay!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 8 - Fast Forward&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The waves of enemies are making their way faster than ever, meaning you’ll have less time to build and gather Supply Drops. But don’t let intimidation slow you down — move fast and get things done in this race against time to Survive the Horde.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 9 - Smog of War&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The volcano’s starting to erupt! A thick cloud of ash coats the area, reducing visibility significantly. Our radar is not functioning properly, so enemies won’t appear on the map!</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 10 - The Floor is Lava&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>The volcano’s in full erupt mode. Staying in contact with the ground for too long will cause a damaging lava eruption below your feet! Keep on the move or take refuge at an elevated position to avoid these perilous hazards.</p>\n\n<h3><br />\n<br />\nChallenge Week 11 - Not-Space Rocks</h3>\n\n<p>Defend your bases and keep your eyes in the skies for falling volcanic debris from above, hot stepper!</p>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools\" style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"highlighter--hover-tools--container\">\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-copy\" title=\"Copy\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-change-color\" title=\"Change Color\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter--icon highlighter--icon-delete\" title=\"Delete\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n","trendingImage":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/24br-hordemode-1-header-1900x600-7b160ae0a573.jpg","cat":"save-the-world","sticky":false,"socialWidget":{"cta":{"_type":"Rift Tour CTA","theme":{"_type":"Rift Tour CTA Theme"}},"_type":"Standalone Social Widget","dateColor":"white"},"featured":false,"date":"2024-04-04T13:00:00.000Z","link":"23a3ae3a-6326-4a7d-99f0-9a57a6f8b200","_id":"23a3ae3a-6326-4a7d-99f0-9a57a6f8b200","pageMapping":"23a3ae3a-6326-4a7d-99f0-9a57a6f8b200","slug":"fortnite-save-the-world-v29-10-apr-4-hotfix","urlPattern":"/blog/fortnite-save-the-world-v29-10-apr-4-hotfix","locale":"en-US","noIndex":false,"_script":"undefined","category":["save-the-world"],"tags":[],"_metaTags":"<meta name=\"description\" content=\"The Scurvy Shoals Venture Season returns to Fortnite Save the World in the v29.20 Apr 4 hotfix, bringing back Survive the Horde with updates and improvements.\">\n<title>Fortnite Save the World v29.10 Apr 4 Hotfix</title>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Fortnite Save the World v29.10 Apr 4 Hotfix\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"Fortnite Save the World v29.10 Apr 4 Hotfix\">\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The Scurvy Shoals Venture Season returns to Fortnite Save the World in the v29.20 Apr 4 hotfix, bringing back Survive the Horde with updates and improvements.\">\n<meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"The Scurvy Shoals Venture Season returns to Fortnite Save the World in the v29.20 Apr 4 hotfix, bringing back Survive the Horde with updates and improvements.\">\n<meta name=\"hero-image-alt\" content=\"Fortnite Save the World v29.10 Apr 4 Hotfix\">","catLocaleMap":{},"nextSlug":"new-and-upcoming-fortnite-shop-and-locker-changes","prevSlug":"complete-fortnite-lantern-trials-in-battle-royale"},{"gridTitle":"Complete Lantern Trials in Battle Royale!","trending":false,"noTopImage":false,"redirect":{"code":"301","_type":"Diesel Redirect"},"image":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-lantern-trials-thumbnail-576x576-17a38d4e8e30.png","contentTypeSticky":false,"author":"The Fortnite Team","enableLightbox":false,"_type":"Common Post","shareImage":"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/fortnite-lantern-trials-2024-1920x1080-1ea10dfd9fc4.png","hasSocialWidget":false,"title":"Complete Fortnite Lantern Trials in Battle Royale!","content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/news/celebrate-fortnites-lantern-fest-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Lantern Fest 2024</a> brightens even more!<br />\n<br />\nWelcome to Fortnite’s <strong>Lantern Trials</strong>.

It’s about the journey along the way! Mechanical Mayhem introduces three vehicle Builds with their own way of taking you place to place. (There are also new ways to make a custom vehicle… more on that in a bit!)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nSpeeder&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Speeder\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-speeder-1920x1080-a0c929c874fe.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIn a hurry? The <strong>Speeder</strong> is ideal for zipping from biome to biome. Unlock the recipe for the Speeder by adding a <strong>Power Cell</strong> (NEW!) to your inventory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nOffroader</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Offroader\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-offroader-1920x1080-16a1c3aa4259.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Offroader</strong> is perfect for carrying around multiple passengers. Unlock the recipe for the Offroader by adding <strong>Flexwood </strong>to your inventory (usually found in the Dry Valley biome).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nHauler</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Hauler\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-hauler-1920x1080-21b1d64f240b.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nLet the <strong>Hauler</strong> do the heavy lifting because there’s plenty of room in the trunk. Unlock the recipe for the Hauler by adding <strong>Frostpine</strong> to your inventory (usually found in the Frostlands biome).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHow to Make Vehicle Builds&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>When you unlock the recipe for a vehicle Build, you can create it from the Builds section of the Build menu.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIf you’re the kind of person who throws away instructions before reading them, you can do things your own way using the <strong>Vehicle Parts</strong> in the Toys section. You’ll need some specific Toys if you want to class your creations as vehicles:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nToys in Your Toolbox</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Power Center</strong> - The engine of your vehicle!</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Load Power Centers up with <strong>Power Cells</strong> to power your vehicles. (That’s a lot of power.) The more Power Cells you load, the longer you can drive for.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Power Center\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-power-center-1920x1080-26b4beb564aa.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>A Power Center.</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Wheels</strong> - Turn in the right direction or give your vehicle an extra push!</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>If your vehicle has <strong>Turnable&nbsp;Wheels</strong> attached, you can use a Driver’s Seat to turn your vehicle. Unlike Turnable&nbsp;Wheels, <strong>Powered Wheels</strong> simply propel your vehicle forward.<br />\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Seats</strong> - For your safety… and comfort!</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>You’ll need a <strong>Driver’s Seat</strong> (a.k.a. steering wheel… they’re finally here!) to control and drive your vehicle. Place some extra Seats to take your friends on road trips.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Drivers Seat\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-drivers-seat-1920x1080-bd72f1599418.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Have a seat… and this picture of one.</em></p>\n\n<h2><br />\nHow to Power Vehicles</h2>\n\n<p>Waste not, want not. LEGO® Fortnite operates on an eco-friendly fuel policy to protect your world’s precious biomes. How? You can recycle your old resources into clean energy with a brand new Station:</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nCompost Bin</h3>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Compost Bin\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-compost-bin-1920x1080-f3fc7c7a024f.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIs your inventory getting busy? Why throw your old items away when you can put them to good use!<br />\n<br />\nThe <strong>Compost Bin</strong> is a new Station that turns resources into <strong>Biomass</strong>, <strong>Fertilizer</strong>, or <strong>Soil</strong>. The number and rarity of what it spits out will depend on what you put in, but you’ll need to create Biomass to unlock the <strong>Power Cell</strong> recipe.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n(One of the ingredients for a Power Cell is Glass. You can now find Glass from bandit camps around your world!)</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nNeed a Tune-Up? Use a Wrench!</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Wrench\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-wrench-1920x1080-8dee384de868.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nIt’s not just Toys in your toolbox. With a <strong>Wrench</strong>, you can assign Switches and Thrusters to channels, which means you can control as many Thrusters as you’d like using three separate Switches, rather than having one Switch controlling everything. Unlock the recipe for the Wrench by adding a <strong>Wooden Rod</strong> to your inventory.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nIlluminate the Dark&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"LEGO Fortnite Illuminator\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/lego-fortnite-illuminator-1920x1080-8719e03365e1.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nThis is for all the night drivers out there. Though not a Vehicle Part, the <strong>Illuminator</strong> will add an aura of light to your world in dark areas! Unlock the recipe for the Illuminator by adding a <strong>Thermal Fish</strong> to your inventory and having a <strong>Crafting Bench</strong> in your world.<br />\n<br />\nReady to become a mechanic after reading everything above? It’s okay if you aren’t — Jules, Comet, and Lynx will steer you in the right direction if you need a hand with vehicles!</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMore Updates!</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nRoar</h3>\n\n<p>The suit-wearing tiger <strong>Oscar</strong> joins Jules, Comet, and Lynx as potential new Villagers!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><br />\nSweet (...and Spicy?) Treats</h3>\n\n<p>Nothing like dessert after fending off foes. You’ll unlock the recipes for <strong>Ice Cream</strong>, <strong>Snowberry Ice Cream</strong>, and <strong>Spicy Ice Cream</strong> if you add <strong>Snow</strong> to your inventory and have a <strong>Juicer</strong> in your world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nMajor Improvements, Adjustments, and Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<h3><br />\nGameplay</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>New <strong>smart transfer feature</strong>: transfer all similar items to and from storage.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>It's easier to visually tell when your constructs take damage.</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>With the new vehicle building features, we had to adjust some durability values. We recommend using higher-rarity resources to strengthen your constructs if any part breaks.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Items can be dropped one at a time when a stack is picked up.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Pools of fish can be found near new (but somehow already run-down) docks that are alongside lakes and rivers.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Made improvements to constructs so they remain stable when entering and exiting caves.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Made stabilization fixes for constructs traveling large distances across the world.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\nOther</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Stormy Emote will be updated to&nbsp;its full, intended animation in LEGO Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nMore Outfits Get a LEGO Style&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>With v29.10, you’ll find even more LEGO Styles for your favorite Outfits!

Keep Personal Info Private</li>\n</ul>\nPlease take the time to read through these updated rules and familiarize yourself with them.\n\n<hr />\n<h2><br />\nWelcome Fortnite Creator!</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/creative\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Creative</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/starting-out-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite\" target=\"_blank\">Unreal Editor for Fortnite</a> tools allow you to create islands that can be published within Fortnite.<br />\n<br />\nFortnite aims to be a safe and fun place for people to play games or hang with their friends, exactly as we say in our <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/community-rules\" target=\"_blank\">Community Rules</a>.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAs you create new islands, games, and experiences within Fortnite, we need your help to keep Fortnite safe, fun, and welcoming to everyone. We also want to make it easy for you to create and be successful with your Fortnite island.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThese rules outline the appropriate ways to create, promote, and monetize your Fortnite island, including some important dos and don’ts. Please take the time to read them carefully before you publish your first Fortnite island and best of luck!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><br />\nApplicable Rules</h2>\n\n<p>Whether built using Fortnite or Unreal Editor for Fortnite, your island is your responsibility, and you must comply with the following rules:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Your <strong>islands</strong> must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/content-guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Content Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Your <strong>behavior</strong> must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/community-rules\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Community Rules</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Any <strong>promotion</strong> of your island, both within and outside of Fortnite, must comply with the rules below, and the <a href=\"https://brand.epicgames.com/d/KCYRTaiFZuRz\" target=\"_blank\">Fortnite Creative Branding Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><span id=\"lego-brand-and-creator-rules\">If you choose to use any LEGO® Templates you must comply with the IP Partner Licensing Agreement and the <a href=\"https://fn.gg/LEGO-Brand-and-Creator-Rules\" target=\"_blank\">LEGO Brand and Creator Rules</a>.</span></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2><br />\nThe Rules</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"1\">1. Content Rules &amp; Guidelines</h3>\n\n<p>As we work together to ensure Fortnite stays a safe and welcoming environment for everyone, your Fortnite content must follow these rules:</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.1\">1.1</span> <strong>A Safe Environment</strong> - Don’t create content involving or promoting illegal activities, including the promotion of known real-world gangs or gang violence, the promotion of known real-world terrorist organizations or terrorism, harassment, bullying, assault, doxing, swatting, gambling, illegal drugs, animal cruelty, fraud, hacking, and piracy. Content that condones or incites violence against others has no place in Fortnite. Depictions of or threats of real-world violence will not be tolerated.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.2\">1.2 <strong>Keep Personal Info Private</strong> - To respect privacy and help combat deceptive practices (phishing, buying/selling account information), do not disclose or request personal information anywhere in your island. There is one exception to this rule: You may include your social media handles/channels as long as they don’t include a URL or QR code or a request for direct or private messages. To preserve the privacy of others, you must not gather, share, or exploit the personal information of individuals or organizations through the use of your island, or attempt to. Do not include videos or photographs of real-life people (yourself or others) anywhere in your island or metadata</span><span>&nbsp;(name, description, thumbnail, loading screen text, and/or Discover video).&nbsp;Epic's voice and text chat within Fortnite include protections like privacy settings, parental controls, and player reporting. So don't provide other chat methods on your island, like chat boxes or custom keyboards.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.3\">1.3 <strong>Intolerance and Discrimination </strong>- </span><span>Fortnite welcomes diversity in race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, national origin, and other groups. Content should not demean, dehumanize, marginalize, use hateful language against, perpetuate negative stereotypes about, or belittle other users or groups. Islands that promote or encourage intolerance or discrimination will not be allowed.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.4\">1.4 <strong>Love… Don’t Hate</strong> - Don’t create content that includes hateful symbols or depictions or content that glorifies or incites violence.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.5\">1.5 <strong>Bullying and Harassment</strong> - Respect others that participate in your creation. Interacting with others in a way that is predatory, threatening, intimidating, lewd, demeaning, derogatory, invasive of privacy, abusive,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>or that would cause real-world harm, including extortion, sextortion, and blackmail,&nbsp;is against the rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.6\">1.6 <strong>Be Original</strong> - Keep your creations original. Don't duplicate, copy, or reproduce other creators’ promotional assets such as thumbnails, titles, and/or descriptions. Don’t pass off your creations as another creator’s work, including by using similar game titles, imagery, etc. Don’t impersonate other players, creators, streamers, celebrities, companies, brands, government officials, Epic employees, or anyone else. Pretending to be someone else in order to deceive or defraud others is not okay.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.7\">1.7 <strong>Respect IP Ownership</strong> - The content you create, publish, or use cannot infringe or violate someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing their copyright or trademark). You must own or have obtained the necessary rights to share and publish the content, and any such license must be broad enough to grant Epic a license consistent with the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/eula\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite EULA</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-supplemental-terms\" target=\"_self\">UEFN Supplemental Terms</a>. More information about copyright can be found <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/faq_copyright.html\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.8\">1.8 <strong>Give Credit Where It’s Required</strong> - If you use content with a license that requires attribution, like <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\" target=\"_self\">Creative Commons 4.0 International</a>, you must give any required credits, such as by using the \"Attributions\" section in the Creator Portal. Keep in mind that some licenses may not be compatible with this tool or with UEFN. If you're not sure that you can meet the license's attribution requirements, don't use the licensed content.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.9\">1.9 <strong>Play by the Rules</strong> - Do not create islands that promote the use of cheats, exploits, glitched items, server crashes, and bugs. Do not use your island as a way to scam other players.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.10\">1.10 <strong>Appropriate Language Only</strong> - Don’t name your island or include on your island obscene text or symbols, nor spelling variations, or visual depictions of text aimed at evading these rules.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.11\">1.11 <strong>All Bets Are Off</strong> - Don’t implement playable gambling content, raffles, or casino-style games. These are prohibited whether or not they involve real money or virtual currency.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.12\">1.12 <strong>Keep It on the Island</strong> - Other than social media handles/channels that comply with Rule 1.2, do not include external links or QR codes anywhere on your island.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.13\">1.13 <strong>Keep It Authentic</strong> - When promoting your island inside Fortnite, the assets (such as thumbnail images, lobby backgrounds, or videos) you use to represent your Fortnite island must accurately represent what players will experience in your island; you must not mislead players as to the sort of experience they will have. You may not mention V-Bucks, currency, or rewards. You must not incorporate elements that mislead players with regards to XP gains, in-game items, or Quests. Where Fortnite already provides a visual element to indicate a feature to the players (e.g. the ability to earn XP in your island, or the selection border of a game tile), you must not imitate or supplement it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Thumbnails must adhere to and follow the Thumbnail Image Guidelines for Discover found in the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/thumbnail-image-guidelines-for-discover\" target=\"_self\">Fortnite Creative Documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span id=\"1.14\">1.14 <strong>Stay within Spec Requirements</strong> - Make sure the islands you are creating do not cause server issues, intentionally or not. Frame rates should stay above 30 FPS.<br />\n<br />\n<span id=\"1.15\">1.15 <strong>Align with Fortnite’s Game Rating </strong>- Fortnite is a teen-rated title and content that exceeds Fortnite’s rating is not allowed. For example, we don’t permit adult content (no pole dancing). Please refer to the <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">IARC Overview</a> for “Maximum Age Ratings in Fortnite.\" We also don't accept content which targets children under 13 as its primary audience (no nursery rhymes). Images and text used to promote your experience must be appropriate for a general audience (e.g. content that would merit a rating of ESRB Everyone 10+, or lower).</span></span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><span><span>Content that is suitable for a general audience cannot contain realistic violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, gore, references to gambling or use of strong language. Examples include:</span></span>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Guns pointed at the viewer, and/or depictions of gunfire</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Mildly sexualized depictions of a character’s body parts, such as breasts or buttocks</li>\n\t\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Images that elicit a strong sense of threat, dread or terror (e.g. grotesque creatures)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">Learn more: <a href=\"https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles-guidelines/\" target=\"_self\">ESRB Ratings Principles and Guidelines</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><span><span>We require all creators to <a href=\"https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative\" target=\"_self\">obtain age ratings</a> for your content via IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) upon publishing. When creating or publishing content for Fortnite, you must also follow these content rules:</span></span></p>\n<span id=\"1.15\"> </span>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\"><span id=\"1.15.1\">1.15.1.&nbsp;<strong>Violence &amp; Gore</strong>: Violence must never be realistic.
